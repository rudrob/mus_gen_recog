The autumn clouds are caving in
And night comes crawling, black as sin
Lightning strikes, and rain begins
A storm that tears my soul

I toss and tumble in my bed
My thoughts are spinning in my head
Darkness nears, soon I'll be dead
I'm losing all control

I've spent my life in foolish quests
for gold and riches, I confess
And now I'm left with just regrets
Too late to change my ways

My life, it seems, has slipped away
I leave no legacy to praise
Nothing more for me to say
My life has been a waste

When!
My time has come for me to leave
When!
When judgment's passed upon my life
When!
A cold dark grave will wait for me
Will!
Will my name live endlessly?
When!
My time has come for me to leave
When!
When judgment's passed upon my life
When!
A cold dark grave will wait for me
Will!
Will my name live endlessly?

So I die
But won't be mourned
Broken and alone
I wish that I were never born

So I die and won't be missed
No rune stone will be raised
As my body rots away

Die!
All friends and cattle pass away
Die!
And death will come for every man
Die!
But I know one thing never dies
Doom!
The sentence passed upon the dead
Now!
The time has come for me to leave
Now!
When judgement's passed up on my life
Now!
Now I will rest in my dark grave
Will!
They speak my name with reverence?

My life has been a waste
No rune stone will be raised
So I die, but won't be mourned
I wish that I were never born
I rest here in my shallow grave
As my body rots away
