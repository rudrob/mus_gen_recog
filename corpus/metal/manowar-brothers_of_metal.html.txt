Strike While The Iron Is Hot
Steel Is Strongest So Say We All
And If We All Were Not Brothers Of Metal Would We Fall? - NO -
They Tried To Test Our Spirit
They Tasted Steel Before We Were Done
Grinding Their Bones Into The Dust Of The Past
All Blown Away Like A Shot From A Gun




We Cast Our Lot Together Four Still Stand As One
Here We'll Remain Forever Till Our Kingdoms One

Brothers Of Metal
We Are Fighting With Power And Steel
Fighting For Metal Metal That's Real
Brothers Of Metal Will Always Be There
Standing Together With Hands In The Air

Let Us Drink To The Power Drink To The Sound
Thunder And Metal Are Shaking The Ground
Drink To Your Brothers Who Are Never To Fall
We're All Brothers Of Metal Here In The Hall

Our Hearts Are Filled With Metal And Masters We Have None
And We Will Die For Metal, Metal Heals, My Son

Brothers Of Metal
We Are Fighting With Power And Steel
Fighting For Metal Metal That's Real
Brothers Of Metal Will Always Be There
Standing Together With Hands In The Air

Let Us Drink To The Power Drink To The Sound
Thunder And Metal Are Shaking The Ground
Drink To Your Brothers Who Are Never To Fall
We're All Brothers Of Metal Here In The Hall

Brothers Of Metal
We Are Fighting With Power And Steel
Fighting For Metal Metal That's Real
Brothers Of Metal Will Always Be There
Standing Together With Hands In The Air
