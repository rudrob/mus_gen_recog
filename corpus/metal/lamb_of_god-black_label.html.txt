                    The human confrontation, I've build a phobia. 
It takes my essence somewhere, somewhere to take control.
I may be far from rocking. I am the one alone. 
I may be far behind lines and made them turn away.

I want to know, hey you, watch out! 
I've made them turn to cripple, hey you, watch out! 
When i will know, who'll know, back fight! 
Why time would let me die to control. 

I fear nothing, why don't you know!? 
I rip my mind and why don't you bleed!? 
I fear no one, why you turn back!? 
I may not stop. 

My freedom can't contain but tell me the pain I liberate, 
Riff hostility to anyone has made us so much hate. 
I made them turn from hate but tell me the pain and suffering 
I made them turn from hate but tell me the pain and suffering I... know.
