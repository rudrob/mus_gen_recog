                    You're welcome to my world, dark side of the universe
I'll take you for a spin, the mayhem begins
The media mouth is feeding and chemical youth that's screaming
The circus starts to roll, there's no turning back

You think it's right, you made you're mind
I've seen so many cross that line
I've seen them come, I've seen them go, times will never change
It's the same old song - The same old song
That's playing again - The same old song

Your soul is burning bright, high hopes of future in sight
Beyond the horizon lays a world that's so black
They'll try to shape your mind and make you walk the line
Don't let them steal your dreams, its all that you've got

You start to doubt, you changed your mind
I've seen so many cross that line
I've seen them come, I've seen them go, times will never change
It's the same old song - The same old song
That's playing again - The same old song

Don't wanna hear it no more

Time to do this, time to do that
I've got an offer you can't refuse it
Just stick with me and I'll push you all the way to the stars
I can't take it no more - The same old song
Its playing again - The same old song
Don't wanna hear it no more - The same old song
Its playing again and again and again - The same old song
