                    Just like a demon's eye
The moon was dancing on the blackened sky
In my sleep nothing is real, dreaming... I'm dreaming

I can feel the shadows lurking

I can feel them closing in

I can hear their evil chanting

This is not a dream for a king

Chorus:

Dancing the Witche's Dance... Dancing the Dance
Dancing the Witche's Dance... Dancing the Dance


Cold hands, leading the way
Through the woods and into the night
Outside nothing is real, dreaming... I'm dreaming

I can see a fire burning
Hooded shapes are all around
I can see a throne of silver
Thirteen we are in all

Chorus

Before the Goat Of Mendes... We all must take our turn

Into the magic circle... Where still the fire burns

We're spinning round and round... Until one takes a fall

The fallen one will not return, the fallen one must burn

(Solo)

Just like a demon's eye
The moon is dancing on the blackened sky
I'm awake but nothing is real
Dreaming... Not dreaming


I can feel the shadows lurking

I can feel them closing in

I can hear their evil chanting

This is not a dream at all

(Chorus)

I wish this was only a dream... A dream
Within a dream

(Solo)

Dancing the Witche's Dance
Dancing till Death

                    Â
