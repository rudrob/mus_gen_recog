                    Upon that storied marble cast thine eye
The scene commands a moralizing sigh
E'en in Areardias blessed Elysium plains
Amidst the laughing nymphs and sparkling flames

Life's emblem here, in youth and vernal bloom
But reasons finger pointing at the...

See festal joy subside, with melting grace
And pity visit the half smiling face
Where now the dance, the hate, the nuptial feast
The passion throbbing in the lover's breast

Life's emblem here, in youth and vernal bloom
But reason's finger pointing at the tomb!

Man: So say me noble stranger, what brings you here this night?
Death: I have come to release you from the bitter taste of life
Man: Why me? Why now? It cannot be my time
Death: Everything that falls to the ground is mine!

Upon that storied marble cast thine eye
The scene commands a moralizing sigh
E'en in Areardias blessed Elysium plains
Amidst the laughing nymphs and sparkling flames

See festal joy subside, with melting grace
And pity visit the half smiling face
Where now the dance, the hate, the nuptial feast
The passion throbbing in the lover's breast

See festal joy subside, with melting grace
And pity visit the half smiling face
Where now the dance, the hate, the nuptial feast
The passion throbbing in the lover's breast

Life's emblem here, in youth and vernal bloom
But reason's finger pointing at the tomb!

Man: But in youth am I still, and in flesh am I strong
Death: And I have a disease for every sin that you have done
Man: But I've done nothing wrong, nothing bad or untrue
Death: Neither God or Devil agrees with you!
