                    I have a problem that I cannot explain,
I have no reason why it should have been so plain,
Have no questions but I sure have excuse,
I lack the reason why I should be so confused,

I know, how I feel when I'm around you,
I don't know, how I feel when I'm around you,
Around you,

Left a message but it ain't a bit of use,
I have some pictures, the wild might be the deuce,
Today you saw, you saw me, you explained,
Playing the show and running down the plane,

I, i know, how I feel when I'm around you,
I don't know, how I feel when I'm around you,
I, i know, how I feel when I'm around you,
I don't know, how I feel when I'm around you,
Around you

I, i know, how I feel when I'm around you,
I don't know, how I feel when I'm around you,
I, i know, how I feel when I'm around you,
I don't know, how I feel when I'm around you,
Around you, around you, around you, around you
