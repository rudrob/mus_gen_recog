                    Quit my job this morning said forever
I would hold my head up high
Cause i need metal in my life
Just like an eagle needs to fly

So i walked outside into the street
From a hall i heard thunder and screams
I walked inside so i could hear
And the guy beside me gave me a beer

He had his fist up in the air
And called me brother said my friends
Are over there

They call themselves immortals
They’re the truest of the true
And in that very moment
I was born again like you

They said hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell

They can’t stop us
Let ’em try
For heavy metal
We would die!

Brothers stand beside me, there’s a battle on
Know my words are true
There’s a battle for true metal
They’re marching; they’re marching on
Me and you

Ten thousand strong are here tonight
With twenty thousand fists up in the air
The power of true metal’s calling you
It’s everywhere

Hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell

They can’t stop us
Let ’em try
For heavy metal
We would die!
