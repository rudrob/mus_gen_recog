                    Can’t see faith through the tears
of my swollen eyes
I try to dry
I pretend it’s not as bad as it seems... what a lie

how can we be so blind
every time a child dies
people are starving
rain forests are falling
the bombs are dropping from the sky

I don’t know why - it sticks in my head
I close my eyes - and it hurts me so bad
I don’t know why - it sticks in my head
I close my eyes - I close my eyes

I close my eyes

I look away from this misery
and I hope the problem will disappear

but it still hurts me everytime a child dies
it’s like a knife you stab in my heart
and twist it, twist it, twist it around

I don’t know why - it sticks in my head
I close my eyes - and it hurts me so bad
I don’t know why - it sticks in my head
I close my eyes - I close my eyes
