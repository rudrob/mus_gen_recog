                    Fool just another
Fool just another

I've been waiting
For signs of god
Create - enslave - behaved
Everything is out of control

Leave me alone
Isolation bears hope
There's something else waiting
A promised destiny
Freezing me
I feel restless and low
These days full of sadness
Had joyfully changed
Into fear
My freakshow will start tonight
Don't miss the right time

Bright eyes
Blinded by fear of life
No Merlin is by my side

Everything is out of control
Everything is out of control
In my future plans
Everything is out of control
No one's left to hurt
Everything is out of control
Sorrow's gone away

Broken memories
Walking upstairs
Step by step
I see the whole world burning
The poet dies in Newerland
How it burns

Hey, mother stubborn
I really hate you
If you say yes I will say no
Ashes to ashes
But dust won't be dust
If you go there
I will go back

Bright eyes
Blinded by fear of life
Betrayed by sunrise
Bright eyes
Blinded by fear of life
No Merlin is by my side

Hey, father stubborn
You're ying
And I'm yang
I feel alone
Who really cares
Born into ashes
To lose all the games
With a smiling face

Bright eyes
Blinded by fear of life
And dark dragons rise
Bright eyes
Blinded by fear of life
No Merlin is by my side

So I sit still in my room, today
Winter's here
In summer season
Shall I say
I was wrong
If I'm right
Farewell to my last hope

                    Â
