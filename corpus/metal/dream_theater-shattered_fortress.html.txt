                    Shattered Fortress


 Songwriters: Myung, John Ro; Petrucci, John P; Portnoy, Michael S; Rudess, Jordan Charles;

Freedom calls my name, serenity keeps me sane
Happiness it dulls the pain
Honest to see my place, open to other ways
Willingness to understand

Justice but do not judge, courtesy for other flaws
Kindness it's not that hard
Self-restraint of tongue and pen, inventory my daily friend
Analysis, let down your guard

Look in the mirror, what do you see?
The shattered fortress that once bound me
Fateful ascent through darkest fires
I've found the path to take me higher

You're smart enough for me to trust, go live your life now
Just keep these steps in your life and you'll know how
If you're not sure ask yourself
Have I done to them as I would have them do to me?

Look in the mirror, what's that you see?
The shattered fortress, fly now be free
Fateful ascent through darkest fires
I've found the path to take me higher

I once thought it better to be right
But now I have finally seen the light
Sometimes you've got to be wrong and learn from mistakes
I live with serenity now not self-righteous hate

Help me be a channel of Thy peace
That where there is hatred I may bring love
That where there is wrong I may bring the spirit of forgiveness
That where there is discord I may bring harmony
That where there is error I may bring truth
That where there is doubt I may bring faith

Now that you can see all you have done
That where there is despair I may bring hope
That where there is shadow I may bring light
It's time to take that step into the kingdom
That where there is sadness I may bring joy

All your sins will help to make you strong
That I may seek rather to comfort than to be comforted
That I may seek to understand rather than to be understood
And help you break right through the prison wall
That I may seek to love, rather than to be loved
For it is by self-forgetting that one finds
It is by forgiving that one is forgiven

Keep all of me, the desires that once burned me deep inside
Help me live today and help to give me grace to carry out your way
I am ready, help me be all I can be
I am ready, help guide me and keep me free

I am responsible when anyone, anywhere reaches out for help
I want my hand to be there
I am responsible when anyone, anywhere reaches out for help
I want my hand to be there
