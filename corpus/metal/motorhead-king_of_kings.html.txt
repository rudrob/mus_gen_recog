                    Behold the King
The King of Kings
On your knees dog
All hail

Bow down to the
Bow down to the King
Bow down to the
Bow down to the King

The King grinned red
As he walked from the place
Where the traitor lost both his name and his face
Through the halls and the corridors
Stinking in blood
He tasted his grin and it tasted good
The King took his head
Left him broken and dead

Bow down to the
Bow down to the King
Bow down to the
Bow down to the King
Bow down to the
Bow down to the King

The King left none living
None able to tell
The King took their heads
And he sent them to hell
Their screams they go loud
In the place of their death
Ripped open they die
With their final breath
They hailed the King
The King of Kings

Bow down to the
Bow down to the King
Bow down to the
Bow down to the King
Bow down to the
Bow down to the King

Into the dirt
His will be done
Now feel your fear
There can be only one

Bow down
Bow down
Bow down to the
Bow down
Bow down
Bow down
Bow down to the
Bow down
Bow down to the
Bow down to the
Bow down to the King
Bow down to the
Bow down
Bow down
Bow down

The King is here
Now feel your fear
The King of Kings

All hail
All hail the King
On your knees
On your knees for the King

The King of Kings
There is only one
