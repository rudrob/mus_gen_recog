                    A Rite Of Passage



This is the new world order, plague upon our peers
Spreading accusations of radical fears
The brotherhood of wisdom, strength and dignity
Its rituals and secrets remain a mystery

Beneath an ever watchful eye
The angels of the temple fly

Turn the key, walk through the gate
The great ascent to reach a higher state, a rite of passage
The final stage, a sacred home
Unlock the door and lay the cornerstone, a rite of passage

Men of wealth and power, influence and fame
Philosophers and leaders are members of the trade
Bound by oath and honor like the rose and cross
An enigmatic union of esoteric thought

Beneath the ever watchful eye
The angels of the temple fly

Turn the key, walk through the gate
The great ascent to reach a higher state, a rite of passage
The final stage, a sacred home
Unlock the door and lay the cornerstone, a rite of passage

Turn the key, walk through the gate
The great ascent to reach a higher state, a rite of passage
The seven stars, the rising sun
A perfect world, a new life has begun, a rite of passage
