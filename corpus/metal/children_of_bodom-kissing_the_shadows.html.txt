                    High above yer shadow smiles at me.
Way down below I hear you serenely breathe.
I m running after you throughout
the valleys of tormented souls,
don t you be afraid of me only kissing your shadow...
You re so far away, I can feel your scent,
when I caress your shadow,
and if you truly want I'll cross the line I'll follow.

I'm dreaming my way out from down below.
To get wherever you haunting from, I'll go...

I'm kissing the shadows you surround me with,
to feel my pain vanishing away from me.
Your touching the shadows I'm surrounding you with,
so together in peace we shall be.

I'm running after you throughout
the valleys of tormented souls,
don t you be afraid of me only kissing your shadow...
You re so far away, I can feel your scent,
when I caress your shadow,
and if you truly want I'll cross the line I'll follow.
