                    Go!

Conflict, terror, hear the noise 
You're in the edge of a nerve-racking  force 
Oh my god, here's the fight 
Never siege, never riot, must defy 

Well, look at me, what do you see ?
Another trophy, a livin' fuckin' dead beat 
Close your eyes, take a step with me
You're soft... no time to waste! 
Insanity and abnormality 
Careful what you call reality 
What you will always want 
It was the day you should die... 

I don't give a flying fuck, motherfucker 
I don't give a flying fuck, motherfucker 
I don't give a flying 
I don't give a flying 
I don't give a flying FUCK! 

I'll never wait for the pain of death 
With a bullet in my gun don't fuck over my shit 
Can you hold my crazy as I go? 
So fuck hypocrisy and fuck you too !

INCOMING! 

Say one, more word 
I double dare you, BRING IT ON! 
Its my world, you're in it 
It'll take you down in a minute 

You can alter, your look 
And diversify your image 
But the truth seems like 
A bitch slap in your face 

(Solo)

Well, look at me, what do you see? 
Another trophy, a livin' fuckin' dead beat 
Close your eyes, take a step inside
You're soft... no time to waste! 
Insanity and abnormality 
Careful not what you call reality 
What you will always want
It was the day you should die...

I don't give a flying fuck, motherfucker 
I don't give a flying fuck, motherfucker 
I don't give a flying 
I don't give a flying 
I don't give a flying FUCK!  

INCOMING! 

Say one, more word 
I double dare you, BRING IT ON! 
Its my world, you're in it 
It'll take you down in a minute 
You can alter your look 
And diversify your image 
But the truth seems like 
A bitch slap in your face 

INCOMING!
