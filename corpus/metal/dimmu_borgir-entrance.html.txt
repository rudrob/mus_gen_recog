                    Soul(s) on departure six six six
Onward into another existence
A trip far beyond all pleasant dreams
A voyage through desolation sights

Inner transformation
Subconscious light
In the glance fields of fires
In the distance meadows of mists
Where minds being enshrouded in complete night
The fading of love, life and light

Wandering an endless journey
Dead within a trace
Entering a lost dominion soulless and free
Visiting a foreign place but yet so known
Another dimension opens for me to see
Heaven sure ain't made for me to be

Soul(s) on arrival six six six
One short step from unhallowed ground
The ground of a Kingdom Come
Dead spirits communion
Unorthodox profane void

Gardens, temples, palaces
I have seen them all
In search for insanity, sanity slowly drowns In trance

                    Â
