                    They say 
We are fools 
We say 
Look at you 

Long ago 
We were just a few 
Still say 
We don't need you 

We don't want to belong 
We said all along 
We just wanna be 
Left alone (x2) 

Think that we 
Must have lost 
Of our way 
Running from the pleas 

You were wrong 
Chose our cause 
Counted off the days 
Enduring in a rage 
We got strong 

We don't want to belong 
We said all along 
We just wanna be 
Left alone 

We don't want to belong 
We said all along 
We just wanna be 
Left alone 

You denied 
Everything that's good 
Reacting as you would 
With your shame 

So we turn 
And left you all behind 
We don't need your kind 
Your to blame 

We don't want to belong 
We said all along 
We just wanna be 
Left alone (X2) 

In years to come 
You hear my name 
When darkness falls 
On judgement day 

They say 
We are fools 
We say 
Look at you 

Long we know  
We were just a few 
Still say 
We don't need you 

Think that we 
Must have lost 
Of our way 
Running from the pleas 

You were wrong 
Chose our cause 
Counted off the days 
Enduring in a rage 
We got strong 

We don't want to belong 
We said all along 
We just wanna be 
Left alone (X4)

                    Â
