                    Far above the Raven Gate 
The spread wings of Blashyrkh wait 

Above the roaring depths 
Sits the oath of frost on the elder Raven Throne 

Older mountains sleeping in my sight 
By chilling woods I stand 

A grimly sound of naked winds 
Is all that it shall be heard from here 

Ohhh... Blashyrkh 

Cometh the rightful kings of the highest halls 
Cry of ravens lurk the realm 
Eternally through the noctambulant grimness 

Demons stride at the gates of Blashyrkh!

Mighty Raven Dark 

Blashyrkh's Mighty Raven Dark!

Blashyrkh....
