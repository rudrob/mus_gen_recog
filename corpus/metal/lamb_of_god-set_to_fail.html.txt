                    You want to blame me for the way you hate yourself
You think you can find who you are in someone else
Criticize to better your relative positioning
You've got a long way to go

So go and weave your tale of woe
Convincing yourself it's so
You're so set to fail

Somewhere you've finally lost your way
Only yourself left to betray

A nameless heir apparent, paranoid despair
You take great measure to appear like you don't care
Precision and persuasion must precede the proper lie
You've lost it before you began

So go and weave your tale of woe
Convincing yourself it's so
you're so set to fail

Somewhere you've finally lost your way
Only yourself left to betray

                    Â
