                    Insectine man, carnivore. The shape of us, the conduct of flies
All-consuming swarm in inconspicuous disguise
Bloodseeking, parasitic. Ecstatically tracing decay
Thriving in the glow that death emits, the warm perfume it radiates

Revolting conformity. Hive mind unity

Excitedly their madness grind, aroused by vile ambition
At the sickly sweet promise of decomposition
Deliriously ingesting. Liquefied ruin absorbed
Innocence devoured by the elated horde

They are us, let's not even pretend

Aroused and frenzied they scurry, encircling death
A vile swarm awaiting the final breath

Myriad eyes visualizing the end
Blackened skies. Rabid heavens descend
On the bereft, unforgivingly

Precious life debased. Our dipteran legacy embraced

Crack the shell. Ascend the sky
Rise, extend your palpitating wings
Crack the shell. Ascend the sky
Fly you disgraceful wretched things

                    Â
