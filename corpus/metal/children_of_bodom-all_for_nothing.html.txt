                    Open your eyes, what have you done?
I've been back, forth stuck yet spun
Too keyed to lie still, too tired to run

I can't believe it's come to this
It's safe to say that ignorance is bliss
Bitter sweet goodbye and one last kiss
Forever is a long time that I won't miss

Too tired to run it's gettin' late
Make up your mind
I was never your kind
This is gonna hurt me black 'n blue
But dont you think that no one measures up to you

I can't believe it's come to this
It's safe to say that ignorance is bliss
Bitter sweet goodbye and one last kiss
Forever is a long time that I won't miss

You feel the hate we're breeding
Fear the life we're leading
Cry while you watch me breeding
The blood i have beeng spilling
The love we keep on killing
Was supposed to be for something...guess it was all for nothing

I can't believe it's come to this
It's safe to say that ignorance is bliss
Bitter sweet goodbye and one last kiss

You feel the hate we're breeding
Fear the life we're leading
Cry while you watch me breeding
Cry while you watch me breeding
