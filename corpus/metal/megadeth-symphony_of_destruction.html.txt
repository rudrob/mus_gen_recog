                    You take a mortal man
And put him in control.
Watch him become a God,
Watch peoples heads a'roll
A'roll, a'roll
A'rolllllll...

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets.
We dance like marionettes,
Swaying to the symphony...
Of destruction.

Acting like a robot,
Its metal brain corrodes.
You try to take its pulse,
Before the head explodes
Explodes, explodes
Explooooodes...

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets.
We dance like marionettes,
Swaying to the symphony...

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes,
Swaying to the symphony,
Swaying to the symphony...
Of destruction.

Solo - Marty Friedman

The earth starts to rumble,
World powers fall.
A'warring for the heavens,
A peaceful man stands tall
Tall, tall
Talllllll...

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets.
We dance like marionettes,
Swaying to the symphony...

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets.
We dance like marionettes,
Swaying to the symphony,
Swaying to the symphony...
Of destruction.
