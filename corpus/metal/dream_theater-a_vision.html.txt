                    A Vision 


Heaven
A place within your eyes
Forever I wear
This second hand disguise
In time to find your world
This lifetime disappears
Yes we understand
In space but not in time
My guardian is here
I can't understand
Imagine wanting nothing more
The angel you've been sending for
Now just don't turn away...
Dreamer
Reaching in and finding out
A vision
I must capture it somehow
The first light
That cast a spell to later cry
Will always remain
This force of life
It's power in a look of fire
Was calling your name
Don't you feel it?
Yes, believe it
It's time to set emotions straight
This space is wasting a dream
And it can't wait
[chorus:]
Here I am
Cross this bridge and come my way
The answer to a prayer
A light for us to share
In all our glory
Someday
We will hold our lives as one
And I will carry you
Until our kingdom come
Can't you hear me?
Disbelief
Is why the spirit falls below
One to one
Is all the faith one needs to grow
This tension I feel
Is it really fair?
One of you will have to leave here
These words will break the line
That ties our worlds together
And I will never go
Remember having dreams to share?
We've been taught to hide our fear
But now you can't turn away...

                    Â
