                    Hence I will anoint
And whisper wholeheartedly
The creed of Hades and beyond
As I succumb to inevitable sin

For I can not enslave myself
With imaginary words of salvation
The hypocrisy that surrounds my temple
Is assisted by pretenders to the throne

The winds that blow purity
Signily my chosen legacy
I was born in opposition
A contender to creation

In sorte diaboli
In sorte diaboli
In sorte diaboli
In sorte diaboli

For my sins
I will ask no forgiveness
For my sins
They are not to forgive

So never speak of me quietly
Stand by my confession
I voice your rebellion
Against the traitor of the world

I am the first creature of this Kingdom
I will be The One
To outlive His time
With the triumph of free will

                    Â
