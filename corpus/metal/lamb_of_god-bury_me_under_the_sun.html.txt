                    A continent and 7 hours away
And still i recall a simpler day
The sun never ever sets here
Burning my last lie

For under the cover of darkness
There's no longer a single lie
Down here there's no more room
For anything but well-bent truth

Bury me under the sun
I'm drowning
Wipe away all that i see
Blind me
Bury me under the sun
Bury me under the sun

The widows watch as they're blinded
And i've been away so long
Perpetual isolation
The knots in its rope
Have come undone

The doors are closed,
She's changed the locks
Judgement's passed, set in stone
Put it up and burn to ash,
Rebuild this broken home

Drowning
Choking on the bitter apprehension
Blind me
Dowsing with escalating tension

Bury me under the sun
Bury me under the sun

We're nothing
Forever cold silence
Only smoking words and dust
Echoes scream of the past
Earning you
More distrust

Apologize to callous ears
A desert of dusty tears
A flock of crows on my blight
Taste the words i should have had
The words i should have had
The words i should have

A continent 7 hours away
And still i yearn for simpler days
The sun never sets here
And it's burning my lies alive

And under the cover of darkness
There's no longer a single lie
Down here there's no more room
For anything but well-bent truth.
