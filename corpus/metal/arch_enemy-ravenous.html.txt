                    I am hunting for your soul
It dwells within your heart
I lacerate the pounding flesh
Your spirits shall be mine

So rise my spirit rise!
Revel in this dead mans' body
Grip his soul, sip the blood
Life is death
A holy carnage

Ravenous
I will be your god
Carnivorous Jesus
I need your flesh

Ritual slaughter
Fill up the chalice
With the essence of your life
Liquid strengths
Trapped in your veins
I crave your blood
You must die!

                    Â
