Will you be using 'em for company [flipping through news broadcasts.]
Business? ...one eight hundred nine
Nine two...for cash back, see store for details...
Meeting rebel leaders, he says he also plans to thank
Russian soldiers for their work in chechnya...work better..."

People around here are driving me crazy
Watching them run is making me lazy
Trying to buy a place in my head
Selling me lines I've already read
Speaking my name to try to confuse me
Say it again you're starting to lose me

That's alright I'm okay
It happens every single day
It's all the same
But I'm not blind

Nevermind
It's either you or me
And I can't see the difference
You or me
I find that I can't see the difference

When are these changes going to stick
Eating my words is making me sick
Some of the time
I'm practically sacred
Reading my mind
Is leaving you naked
You'd rather give it away than receive it
One of these days I'm gonna believe it.

That's alright I'm okay
It happens every single day
It's all the same
But I'm not blind

Nevermind
It's either you or me
And I can't see the difference
You or me
I find that I can't see the difference

You or me
And I can't see the difference
You or me
I find that I can't see the difference

You or me
That's alright I'm okay
It happens every single day
And I can't see the difference
It's all the same
But I'm not blind
Nevermind
It's either
You or me
That's alright I'm okay
It happens every single day
I find that I can't see the difference
It's all the same
But I'm not blind

"...my position was that if anybody [right-channel samples from ? ? ? ]
Who's a christian would go there,
They're not only aligning themselves to the demagogue,
They're aligning themselves to the antichrist! which
By the way, this man is an antichrist..."
"did you see the video? "
"i didn't need to see the video to call the guy an antichrist..."

"...if you can truly appreciate..."[left-channel samples from ? ? ? ]

"...sins, so that we'll go to heaven [center-channel sample from ? ? ? ]
Anyway. he came to save his people
From their sins."
