                    My descent is the story of everyman 
I am hatred, darkness and despair 
My descent is the story of everyman 
I am hatred, darkness and despair 

Evoked and entertained through centuries 
Wrathful and sullen -- Dormant still 

The ferocity pervades everywhere 
Waiting to be released at last 
Hear my offering 
Ye bastard sons and daughters 
Share my sacrifice 
Share my sacrifice. 

My descent is the story of everyman 
I am hatred, darkness and despair 
My descent is the story of everyman 
I am hatred, darkness and despair 

Reconcile not with the fear of the snake 
But embrace it as your own 
Inject its venom into your veins 
And replant the seed that gives growth 
Still shrouded in mystery 
Until you arise above perception 
A veil of ignorance is in motion 
Continuing throughout generations 

(A veil of ignorance is in motion 
Continuing throughout multiple generations 
Let me be the one that deliver you from the deceit 
And back into perfect accordance with the laws of nature) 

The snake is notoriously tempting 
But the snake is fair 
What is worse than not knowing? 
To live or disappear? 

The ferocity pervades everywhere 
Waiting to be released at last 
Hear my offering 
Ye bastard sons and daughters 
Share my sacrifice 
Share my sacrifice

                    Â
