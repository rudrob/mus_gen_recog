                    Stay with me a while,
Rise above the vile.
Name my final rest,
Poured into my chest.

Into the orchard i walk peering way past the gate.
Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait.
Drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead.
Halo of death, all i see is departure.
Mourner's lament but it's me who's to martyr.

Pledge yourself to me ,
Never leave me be,
Sweat breaks on my brow,
Given time ends now.

Into the orchard i walk peering way past the gate.
Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait.
Drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead.
Halo of death, all i see is departure.
Mourner's lament but it's me who's to martyr.

Spirit painted sin,
Embers neath my skin,
Veiled in pale embrace,
Reached and touched my face.

Into the orchard i walk peering way past the gate.
Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait.
Drained by the coldest caress, stalking shadows ahead.
(Release your grip)
Halo of death, all i see is departure.
(and let me go)
Mourner's lament but it's me who's to martyr.
(into the night)

                    Â
