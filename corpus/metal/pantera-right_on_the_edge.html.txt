                    Shot rings out
Hear somebody scream
Nightmare
Caught up in a fantasy
Tied up
Fear's workin' overtime
Wrecks my sanity
Lay down
Ear touched the floor
Telephone rings
It's someone at the door
It's alright
Just the paperboy
Hear with the magazines

Can't you see i'm
Right on the edge
On the verge
Of going crazee
My whole life's been livin'
Right on the edge
Don't you try and stop me
Life is drivin' me insane

Lights out
Can't see a damn thing
Shot down
Eyes of a hurricane
It's all wrong
Stumble outa bed
Reach for a cigarette
Busted
Runnin' in the dead of nite
Locked up
Back of a black and white
Too late
Gotta pay the price
Luck's runnin' out again

Can't you see i'm
Right on the edge
On the verge
Of going crazee
My whole life's been livin'
Right on the edge
Don't you try and stop me
Life is drivin' me insane

I'm not crazee!!!!!!!!
