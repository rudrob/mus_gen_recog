                    Sons Of Northern Darkness

Riding through the blackfires of endless time
The icy dawn lifts with an horizon like nordens on fire
Still peace breathes throughout the realm...
This ride will be the one...

The morning sun gleam upon these peaceful plains...
Far beyond the realms of fire and ice
The legions marches on...
Now blow the might horns of war

Fly throughout the sky... set fire to the land
Fly throughout the sky... Sons of Northern Darkness

Anger rideth with the one that knows no fear
Who's eyes like fire - who's hearts like ice

Spirits rideth with the ones that knows no fear
They are the Sons of northern darkness

Wisdom rideth with the ones that knows no fear
As old as the northern wind blow
Blow over grim moors...

Gathered we all storm the land...
The sound of triumph in the air
The legions marches on...
Now hear the mighty battleblasts

Fly throughout the sky... set fire to the land
Fly throughout the sky... Sons of northern darkness
