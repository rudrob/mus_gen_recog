                    In My Kingdom Cold

Forth after dark... a time I do know
In my kingdom... I enter to my own world
Open the gate... of a mountain of dark
Rising with the shadow... a dark world made for me

Black my mind... black my heart...
In my kingdom... I enter to my own world
Open the gate... of a mountain of black
Rising with the shadow... a black world made for me

Frozen and cold... an existence I do know...
In my kingdom cold I enter this condition
Open the gate... of a mountain of ice
Rising with the shadows... a cold world made for me

Forth after dark... a time I do know
In my kingdom... I enter to my own world
Open the gate... of a mountain of dark
Rising with the shadow... a dark world made for me

In my kingdom cold...
At the mountains of madness
Unending grimness
These mountains which I heart
In my kingdom cold...
At the mountains of madness
Unending grimness this kingdom it is mine...
