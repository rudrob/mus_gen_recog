                    One, two, three, four, one, two

Mama, she has taught me well
Told me when I was young:
"Son, your life's an open book
Don't close it 'fore it's done"
"The brightest flame burns quickest" 
That's what I heard her say
Son's heart sowed to mother
But I must find my way

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still 
Yeah, still

Rebel - my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains

Left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
but what is said is done

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Never I asked of you 
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you 
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still

Mama, now I'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
A mother's love for her son 
Unspoken, help me be
Yeah, I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me, yeah.
I need your arms to welcome me
but a cold stone's all I see

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So let this heart be still
Oh, oh, oh, woah

Never I asked of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I asked of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still
