                    The kombucha mushroom people
Sitting around all day
Who can believe you?
Who can believe you?
Let your mother pray

Sugar
Sugar

I'm not there all the time, you know 
Some people, some people, some people
Call it insane
Yeah, they call it insane (sugar) 

I play Russian Roulette everyday, a man's sport
With a bullet called life
Yeah mama, called life (sugar) 
You know that every time I try to go 
Where I really wanna be
It's already where I am
Cause I'm already there 

The kombucha mushroom people
Sitting around all day
Who can believe you?
Who can believe you?
Let your mother pray

Sugar

I got a gun the other day from Sako
It's cute, small, fits right in my pocket
Yeah, right in my pocket (sugar) 
My girl, you know, she lashes out at me sometimes
And I just fucking kick her and then, oh baby 
She's okay (sugar) 

People are always chasing me down
Trying to push my face to the ground
Where all they really want to do
Is suck out my mother fucking brains
My brains

Sugar

The kombucha mushroom people
Sitting around all day
Who can believe you?
Who can believe you?
Let your mother pray

I sit in my desolate room
No lights
No music
Just anger
I've killed everyone
I'm away forever
But I'm feeling better

How do I feel? What do I say?
Fuck you, it all goes away
How do I feel? What do I say?
Fuck you, it all goes away

How do I feel? What do I say?
In the end it all goes away
How do I feel? What do I say?
In the end it all goes away
How do I feel? What do I say?
In the end it all goes away

How do I feel? What do I say?
In the end it all goes away
How do I feel? What do I say?
In the end it all goes away
How do I feel? What do I say?

In the end it all goes away
In the end it all goes away
In the end it all goes away
In the end it all goes away
In the end it all goes away
