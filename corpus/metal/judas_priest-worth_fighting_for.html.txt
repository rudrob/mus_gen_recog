                    You said I could never find a way to ease your mind
That where I'd go you'd wind up in the dust
I tried so hard to have you reach another side of me
Instead you went to nowhere and forgot

So I wander on
Asking where you might have gone
From what I knew before
Some things are worth fighting for

Desert heat can wear you down
But still I'm rollin' through
Did I see your figure in the haze?
I am driven by a thirst to quench myself of love
The sun beats on me for the price I've paid 

So I wander on
Asking where you might have gone
From what I knew before
Some things are worth fighting for
Yeah!

Night road leads me to a town of ghosts
Beckoned by the glow of keresone & tumbleweed
They're calling out (they're calling out)
Forever more (forever more) 

I'm leaning in the wind
Head bowed down from what I saw
My shadow for a friend
Still some things are worth fighting for

So I'm moving on
Asking where you might have gone
From what I knew before
Some things are worth fighting for
Yeah!

Worth fighting for

                    Â
