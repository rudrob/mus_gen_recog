                    Hello me... Meet the real me 
And my misfits way of life 
A dark black past is my 
Most valued possession 
Hindsight is always 20-20, 
But looking back it's still a bit fuzzy 
Speak of mutually assured destruction? 
Nice story... Tell it to Reader's Digest! 

Chorus 
Feeling paranoid 
True enemy or false friend? 
Anxiety's attacking me, and 
My air is getting thin 
I'm in trouble for the things 
I haven't got to yet 
I'm chomping at the bit, and my 
Palms are getting wet, sweating bullets. 


Hello me... It's me again 
You can subdue, but never tame me 
It gives me a migraine headache 
Thinking down to your level 
Yea, just keep on thinking it's my fault 
And stay an inch or two outta kicking distance 
Mankind has got to know 
His limitations 

Chorus 
Feeling claustrophobic 
Like the walls are closing in 
Blood stains on my hands and 
I don't know where I've been 
I'm in trouble for the things 
I haven't got to yet 
I'm sharpening the axe and my 
Palms are getting wet, sweating bullets 

Solo-Dave

Well, me... it's nice talking to myself 
A credit to dementia 
Some day you too will know my pain 
And smile its blacktooth grin 
If the war inside my head 
Won't take a day off I'll be dead 
My icy fingers claw your back 
Here I come again 

Chorus 
Feeling paranoid 
True enemy or false friend? 
Anxiety's attacking me 
And my air is getting thin 
Feeling claustrophobic 
Like the walls are closing in 
Blood stains on my hands and 
I don't know where I've been 
Once you committed me 
Now you've acquitted me 
Claiming validity 
For your stupidity 
I'm chomping at the bit 
I'm sharpening the axe 
Here I come again, whoa! 
Sweating bullets
