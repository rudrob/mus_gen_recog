                    An even strobe a pulse of flashing 
Hate-lights of synthetic souls mass-produced 
Hammered into shape a sign of times dreams 
Turn into systems a new way a new breed 
Implanted in our minds 

Here i am in the hand of a sterile hate the 
New control i can not wake i'm not a sleep 

New intelligence arise in emptied bodies 
Turgid flesh tested through eternal spastic 
Fits through not known codes mother 
Machine in genocide now scorn a dying race 

Evolution in reverse now it's time for me 
Changing what am i to be contorted an 
Eternity defeated 

Programmed to appease you we're symbols of 
Perfection humanoids ruined by your laws: 
Destroy erase improve lesson first: sub- 
Mission we're docile servant dogs our 
Leashes are your limbs computed deep 
Within 

Remoted minds controlled our thoughts no 
More doubts the new way is here disgorged 
Another thousands fakes that obey to a 
Circuit skein to vacuum 

Mechanical thoughts i now conceive no 
Longer me always to see inanity millions 
To be units like me eternally human 
Patterns copied dissected distorted 
Completed to fit the machine the nerve 
Fibers give in to cords to the unknown 

See me be me same contents same machine 

The currency of ours no more flesh and bone 
We are to be unaware of what we have been 
Before 

Evolution in reverse now it's time for me 
Changing what am i to be contorted an 
Eternity defeated by the new machine

                    Â
