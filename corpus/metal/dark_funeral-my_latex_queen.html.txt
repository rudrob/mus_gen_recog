                     Here I am, through the gloom stare
Again in hunger, and thirst for something new

Tonight - my hunger I'll please...
Your presence makes my pulse increase...
There she is - all in shiny black
Gothic queen, come with me
Let's get closer - let's unite
Let me enter you, and become as one

I beg for thee please bend down
I want to see you from behind
You move your hips, side to side
Feel me - go down...

Latex queen - feel my tongue in deep
Whirls around - climax is almost found
I rise to my feet - erection slides in deep
I pound you hard - latex queen feels so sweet
Feels so sweet...

Latex queen - feels so sweet

We become as one...

"I love the way you feel, when I'm inside"
"I love the way - your latex shine"

"Deep inside of you, and full of seed"
Oh my latex queen - I am your steed"
