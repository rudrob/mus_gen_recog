                    This ritual must never end
The blood runs warm from the sacrificial shrine
Inflicting open wounds
As dirty claws grab her trembling fucking neck

This ritual must never end
The cuts run deep as we feast upon her cries
Her punctured bleeding heart
Pounding with fear

Her painful screams echo through the night
Her blood shall flow and cover
the remnants of her severed flesh
Her struggling hands only trigger more
The rest will follow, in death and chaos as I drive

The nail in her coffin
A spear through her heart

The ceremony has just begun
The blood runs warm down her sanctimonious thighs
We carve another wound
Our blood stained hands rip her dirty little dress

We sacrifice this dying earth
Her lying God is waiting naked on the ground
He wants her open wounds
Just like a well trained dog he's waiting for his turn

Her violent screams make the world convulse
As we arrange a shallow grave

This ritual must never end
The blood runs warm from the sacrificial shrine
We open up her beating chest
As dirty claws grab her trembling fucking neck

Her painful screams echo through the night
Her blood shall flow and cover
the remnants of her severed flesh
Her struggling hands only trigger more
The rest will follow, in death and chaos as I drive

A nail in her coffin
A spear through her heart

Mother of life
Deceased and erased
Forgotten and buried
Forever
