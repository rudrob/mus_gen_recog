                    Earth has burst
Mountain flames
Moon beheld
Father snake
Mind control
Has left its nest
Shame on
Bulls roar loud
The fearless fall
Wooden vessel
Broken wings
Caught my killer
In my grave
Shame on


Eyes of grace
Kill again
Trapped in maze
Trembling fear
Head scorched brow
Perish the land
Shame on


A vast calm wilderness
The call to adventure comes
Lead and land atop this rock
Infinite path carved with unrivaled skill

                    Â
