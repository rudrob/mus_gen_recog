                    Inner perception trapped in a soul cage 
human wreckage i leave my liquid face 
who am i senses blurred who's my mind 
in this life obscured 
visual progressions leave me no peace 
subliminal merger clutch the 
fence of needs 
what's there in desperation what's real 
flawless confusion 

Void of emptiness reign my truth 
before my eyes flashes of youth 
memory-nuances pass where's my life 
frayed pictures mass 
insidious deception feelings fade 
ravenous mirrors i praise the 
blackened day 
what am i to reality what's in line 
subsequently 

Forever turning through a lifetime 
endless burning of soul and mind 
step by step i'm taken through the past 
to burn in fear of lies i'm lost mouldering 
oblivions grasp makes my soul burn 
burn 

This astray mind has sieged my soul 
forever chained to this tearing cold 
i'll never tell the truth from lies 
disbelief covers my eyes i'm lost mouldering 
perpetual pain in this soul burn 

Pieces to me strange wrapped up disguise 
reflections of myself in another life 

I see it vague before my eyes 
pictures drawn of naked bare lies 
it makes no sense to live this mess 
constant until i find my rest 
enemy within a soul in flames 
gaining its pulse breeding inside 
pressure increase drowns my belief 
as i unveil myself in me 
burn

                    Â
