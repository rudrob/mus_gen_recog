Good luck has never been my friend
I've always been the fool.
Please don't follow shadows of mine,
'Cause the time is running out for me
I walk in the path of a misfits blood
No compass can stare my way
No light at the end of the tunnel
And time is running out for me

No gold at the end of the rainbow,
No high hopes, dreams deceive.

Follow me
The trouble seems to always wanna
Follow me
It has let me down so far so why don't you
Follow me
The trouble seems to always wanna
Follow me
It has let me down so far so why don't you
Follow me

I walk in the path of a misfits blood
No compass can stare my way
No light at the end of the tunnel
And time is running out for me

No gold at the end of the rainbow,
No high hopes, dreams deceive.
