                    My cock is much bigger than yours
(My cock can walk right through the door) 
With a feeling so pure 
(It's got you screaming back for) 

Cool, in denial 
We're the cruel regulators smoking 
Cigaro, cigaro, cigaro 
(x2)

My shit stinks much better than yours 
(My shit stinks right down to the floor) 
With a feeling so pure 
(It's got you coming back for more) 

Cool, in denial 
We're the cruel regulators smoking 
Cigaro, cigaro, cigaro
(x4)

Can't you see that I love my cock?
Can't you see that you love my cock?
Can't you see that we love my cock?

We're the regulators that deregulate 
We're the animators that de-animate 
We're the propagators of all genocide 
Burning through the world's resources 
Then we turn and hide 

We're cool, in denial 
We're the cruel regulators smoking 
Cigaro, cigaro, cigaro 
(x2)

We're the regulators that deregulate 
We're the animators that de-animate 

We're cool, in denial 
We're the cruel regulators smoking 
Cigaro, cigaro,cigaro
(x2)

My cock is much bigger than yours 
My cock can walk right through the door 
With a feeling so pure 
It's go you screaming back for more
