                    I turn off the Lights, we like Darkness
Now you call my Name, you finally came
Even in the Night I see the Light shining
bright
I'm alone with my Friends
Now I see you clear, we raise our Glasses
Welcome to my House Princess of Hell
Even in the Night I see the Light shining
bright
I'm alone with my Friends
I will bring in here my Crystal Ball
I will gaze, you will know what is to come
Solo: M.D. Solo: H.S.
I'm amazed of what I've seen tonight
I won't tell a living Soul, they would not
believe
Welcome Princess of Hell
Never will I break the Oath I gave
I hail you again in Satan's Name, Princess
of Hell
Even in the Night I see the Light shining
bright
I'm alone with my friends
We will be back, we will be back
