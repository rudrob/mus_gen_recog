                    The piercing radiant moon
The storming of poor June
All the life running 
Through her hair

Approaching guiding light
Our shallow years in fright
Dreams are made winding 
Through my head
Through my head

Before you know
Awake

Your lives are open wide
The V chip gives them sight
Off all the life running 
Through her hair

The spiders all in tune 
The evening of the moon
Dreams are made winding 
Through my head
Through my head

Before you know
Awake 

Through my head
Through my head
Before you know
Before 
you know I will be waiting all awake

Dreams are made winding 
Through her hair
Dreams are made winding 
Through her hair

                    Â
