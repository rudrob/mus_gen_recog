                    Storming the borders of chaos
For the cause of a battle once strong
Faster than the wind we rode
To where our blackened hordes dawned

Armed in the fires of combat
The end will come fast on this day
Stronger than the gods we fought
Triumphant for the dark prophecies

Besiege the thrones of reverence
Gods of all fiery fate
Besiege the thrones of reverence
Warriors crowned this day

The dark tales of wrath, bred on steel
An allegiance of great tyranny at the hand of darkness
A force to rule above all so that those who with pride
Lust and will eager to stride

Rise those who despise the weak
Spare none and ride proudly on the winds of death
All defeated by our call, all defeated by the wars
Under the hovering thunders of darkness

All shall fall

Storm forth through battle of fury
All giant warrior be
Blacker than the winds of death
Stronghold and fear blind the weak

Brought at the borders of chaos
For the cause of a battle once strong
Faster than the wind we rode
To where our blackened hordes dawned

Besiege the thrones of reverence
Gods of all fiery fate
Besiege the thrones of reverence
Warriors crowned this day
