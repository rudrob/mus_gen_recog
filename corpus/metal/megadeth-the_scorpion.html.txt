                    My life is everything 
That feeds my thirst that causes sin 
My wants are all I care 
No shame and guilt, there's nothing there 
Look deep into my face 
I sell deceit without a trace 
Fear not what I can do 
Unless you want it done to you, oh-ohhh! 

As I climb onto your back, I will promise not to sting 
I will tell you what you want to hear, and not mean anything 
Then I treat you like a dog as I shoot my venom in 
You pretend you didn't know that I am a scorpion, oh 

My self I'm centered in 
There's nothing else, there's never been 
And I dream, to be left alone 
With the sadness, the madness of my own 
Look deep into my soul 
It's black as coal like a bullet hole 
Fear not, get off your knees 
There's no defense, you'll do what I please, oh-oh! 

As I climb onto your back, I will promise not to sting 
I will tell you what you want to hear, and not mean anything 
Then I treat you like a dog as I shoot my venom in 
You pretend you didn't know that I am a scorpion, oh 

As I climb onto your back, I promise not to sting 
I tell you what you want to hear, and not mean anything 
I will treat you like a dog as I shoot my venom in 
'Cause you knew all along I am a scorpion, ya! 

My lies, to reach the shore 
I aggrandize and nothing more 
My hopes, to steal away 
All that you love, I'll soon betray 
Look deep into my past 
The pain I deal is unsurpassed 
I'm not a lowly scorpion 
I'm so much worse; I'm the fall of man

                    Â
