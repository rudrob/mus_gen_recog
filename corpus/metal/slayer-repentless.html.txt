                    Arrogance, violence, world in disarray
Dealing with insanity every fucking day
I hate the life, hate the fame, hate the fucking scene
Pissing match of egos, fuck their vanity
Ain't got the time, I don't want anything from you
Feeding on my tolerance is all you fucking do
No looking back, no regrets, no apologies
What you get is what you see

Live fast, on high
Repentless, let it ride

My songs relive the atrocities of war
Can't take society any fucking more
Intensity, anarchy, hatred amplified
Playing this shit is all that keeps me alive
I leave it all on the road living on the stage
This is my life where I kill it everyday
So take you shot, bottom's up, this is no lie
I'll be beating this guitar 'til the day I die

Live fast, on high
Repentless, let it ride

I hate the life, hate the fame, hate fucking scene
Pissing match of egos, fuck their vanity
Ain't got the time, I don't want anything from you
Feeding on my tolerance is all you fucking do
No looking back, no regrets, no apologies
What you get is what you see
We're all killing ourselves a little more everyday

Live fast, on high
Repentless, let it ride
