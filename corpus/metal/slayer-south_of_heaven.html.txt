                    An unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time
Unsuspecting victims no warning, no signs.
Judgement Day. The second coming arrives.
Before you see the light you must die !

Forgotten children, conform a new faith,
Avidity and lust controlled by hate.
Never ending search for your shattered sanity,
Souls of Damnation in their own reality.

Chaos rampant, an age of distrust.
Confrontations, impulsive habitat.

Bastard sons begat your cunting daughters,
Promiscuous mothers with incestuous fathers.
Engreat souls condemned for all eternity,
Sustained by immortal odservance a domineering deity.

Chaos rampant, an age of distruct.
Confrontations, impulsive sabbath.

On and on, South of Heaven  x4

SOLO

The root of all evil is the heart of black souls.
A force that has lived all eternity.
A never ending search for a truth never told
The loss of all hope and your dignity.

Chaos rampant, an age of distrust.
Confrontations, impulsive habitat.

On and on, South of Heaven.  x4
