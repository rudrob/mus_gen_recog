                    You can bitch all you want, cause I don't care.
It's a real fine line between being good and being bad.
Might as well crash and burn cause we never ever gonna learn.
I rather stick to being a bad boy than being real burned.

Now I got your attention.
I need to ease my mind.
You think you are the main attraction.

I am your great pretender,
The hero and your savior.
I am your great pretender,
The alien you surrender to.

Now when our future is dark and it's hard to predict.
Can someone please please tell me, Who am I supposed to be.
I just keep on rolling till someone stops me.
Don't want live in the past, I just want to be me.

Now I got your full attention.
I need to ease my mind.
You think you are the main attraction.

I am your great pretender,
The hero and your savior.
I am your great pretender,
The alien you surrender to.

Reach for the sky, and I'll be there.
Step into the light, I'll pull you trough.
Just close your eyes, and take my pills.

I am your great pretender,
The hero and your savior.
I am your great pretender,
The alien you surrender to.
