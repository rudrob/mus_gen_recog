                    Father
I call your name upon the furious winds
I'm possessed by the spiritual strength of hell
In the chambers of my dark heart a black flame burns
Satan
I summon the horned one from the darkened realms
Grant me the darkened unholy power
To please my evil wicked lust
The coveted hour has finally arrived
The hour when darkness over skies descends
Under the pale light of the frozen moon
I prepare the virgin for sacrifice
I whisper forbidden names upon the skies
Nocturnal visions reveal before me
Nightfall embraces my hateful cries
As I fullfil my dark desires

My dark desires
My dark desires
My dark desires
My dark desires

Satan
Take my soul to hell
I must burn in the unholy flames
Satan
Take my soul to hell
I must burn to purify my weak soul
Father
I call your name upon the furious winds
I'm possessed by the spiritual strength of hell
In the chambers of my dark heart a black flame burns
Satan
I summon the horned one from the darkened realms
Grant me the darkened unholy power
To please my evil wicked lust
The coveted hour has finally arrived
The hour when darkness over skies descends
Under the pale light of the frozen moon
I prepare the virgin for sacrifice
Bring damnation upon my soul

My dark desires
My dark desires
My dark desires
My dark desires

Satan
Take my soul to hell
I must burn in the unholy flames
Satan
Take my soul to hell
I must burn to purify my weak soul
