                    Dismantling the clockwork that makes me the cynic
 Pallet, wheel and click
 The properties of my indifference
 Reverse-engineering what makes it tick
 Dissecting the finetuned mechanism
 Rack and barrel, spring and pin
 Its synchronous characteristics
 To kill what makes it spin

 Disassemble this machinery
 Re-program these eyes, undo this design

 Labelled and filed, each part indexed
 Broken to pieces then thoroughly burned
 Deconstruction of what I am
 Buried to make sure he never returns
 Taken apart, defused, blueprints turned to ashes
 Eradicate the last remains, remnants of the insane

 Disintegration, the destruction of me now imperative
 To purge myself of this condition, complete this dissolution a necessity

 Break this deceitful machine

 A lie, what once I was, obsolete instrument
 An outmoded contraption, a malfunctioning device

 That callous self now extinguished, that malignant self now disused
 That conceited invention to nothing now reduced

 Complete disintegration, the destruction of me now imperative
 To purge myself of this condition, complete this dissolution a necessity

 Break this deceitful machine
