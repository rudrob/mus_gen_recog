                    We belong to the world we belong to the wind 
We are the spirit of the competition´s end 
Turning hours into days buning muscles feel the pain 
The heart and soul of discipline my friends 

We are sending you a challenge it´s very clear 
We came to win that is why we are here 
Demanding to be tested tested by the best 
Not to be forgotten like all the rest 

The time has come all the training done 
The muscle and the blood will come to pay 

Let the game begin hear the starting gun 
Play from the heart today we will overcome 
When the game is over all the counting´s done 
We were born to win number 1 

Today is the day all the training through 
We have come for the number one not the number two 
Let the contest begin play hard fight to win 
Immortality victory and fame 

The time has come all the training done 
The muscle and the blood will come to pay 

Let the game begin hear the starting gun 
Play from the heart today we will overcome 
When the game is over all the counting´s done 
We were born to win number 1 

Today is the day all the training through 
We have come for the number one not the number two 
Let the contest begin play hard fight to win 
Immortality victory and fame 

Let the game begin hear the starting gun 
Play from the heart today we will overcome 
When the game is over all the counting´s done 
We were born to win number 1
