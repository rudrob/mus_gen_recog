                    Not long ago but far away.
A rainy winter's day.

All her pain she kept inside.
Could no longer hide.

No cry for help.
She killed herself.

Both life and love could not be saved.
She took them both to the grave.

to the grave.

A pair of souls become undone.
Where were two now one.

Divided by this wall of death.
I soon will join you yet.

With my blood I'll find your love.

You found the strength to end your life.
As you did -- so shall I.

Oh no.
Please don't go.
Please don't go.

It's like a death
A death,
A death
In the family.

Don't die.

A crimson pool so warm & deep.
Lulls me to an endless sleep.

Your hand in mine - I will be brave.
Take me from this earth.

And end this night - this, the end of life.

From the dark I feel your lips.
And I taste your bloody kiss.

Oh no.
Please don't go.
Oh no.
Please don't go.

Please don't go
Please don't go,
Please don't
Please don't
Go.

It's like a death
A death,
A death
In the family.

[x2]
It's like a death
A death,
A death
In the family.

Don't die
On me,
Don't die
On me.

Don't die
On me
Don't die

                    Â
