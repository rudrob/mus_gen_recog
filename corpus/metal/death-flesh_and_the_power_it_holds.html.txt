                    I told you once but I will say it again
When you live the flesh 
It is the beginning of the end
It will take you in
It will spit you out
Behold the flesh and the power it holds

Passion is 
a poison laced with pleasure bitter sweet
One of many faces 
That hide deep beneath
It will take you in
It will spit you out
Behold the flesh and the power it holds

Touch, 
Taste, 
Breathe, 
Consumed.

Deja-vu
Already knew
From the first encounter
But know I know 
To let go of words 
To speak no more

Like a wind upon your face you can't see it
But you know it's there, 
When beauty shows
its ugly face, 
Just be prepared.

(Solo Schuldiner)

Passion burns
Like fire carried by the wind
The end of a time, 
A time to begin
It will take you in
It will spit you out
Behold the flesh and the power it holds

It builds you up
One way and tears you right back down
A time to begin
The end of a time.
It will take you in
It will spit you out
Behold the flesh and the power it holds

Touch, 
Taste, 
Breathe,
Consumed.

Deja-vu
Already knew
From the first encounter
But know I know 
To let go of words 
To speak no more

Like a wind upon your face
You can't see it but you know it's there, 
When beauty shows
its ugly face, 
Just be prepared.
