                    Convalescent livid we succumb 
stagnation now complete 
this is the new plague called 
unconsciousness 
we're self-caged in defeat 
clotted minds coagulate we are trapped 
inside the tears we obey resignate to our 
self-inflicted fears 

Voices calm will be never heard 
in this mode who will change 
bantised in our minds so absurd 
is this the world sublime 
into pools of paranoia we're fading with 
reality drained by lies we are all inhuman 
introspective vanishing 

Sterile thoughts now upraised in subhuman 
majesty bodies numb still enchained 
where am i in hell of our dreams 
wrong wrong i'm in the now the vain reality 

So it seems we're dying yet content 
worship our chrysalis stage since when are 
lies divine 

Since when 

This is now degrade indulge 
this is us servile obliging 

Swallowed by our hunger for mendacity 
as this dance whirls deeper into hate 

We're vanishing 

In down deep cold where am i caught cage 
trapped not in dreams now time has killed 
our eyes fall fade gone dead away

                    Â
