                    Alive alone now that they've gone dead but unburied
I've seen it unfold, terrible scenes of agony
Eyes in the darkness
Echoing their madness

The sights that have passed before them
Watching as though it has never happened
Now I only listen to what is not spoken

Murder, hatred
Anger, Savage
Killings I have caused
more than can be counted
orgies of sadism
And sexual perversion
Virgin
Tied to my mattress
Legs spread wide
Ruptured bowel, yanked
From her insides
Devirginized with my knife
Internally bleeding
Vagina, secreting
her blood-wet pussy
I am eating
on her guts I am feeding
Mutilated with a machete
I fucked her dead body
The first and last
Your life's only romance
My knife's jammed in your ass
As you die you orgasm

Pass on to the dead
Nerve trembling convulsions
No longer looking human

I never see them, but I know they're there
Locked in my subconcious
Obscene memories I thought I'd forgotten
Haunting unrealities
Tear at me
Hold her arms
Her mouth taped shut
Screams unheard
Out pour her guts

Layers of flesh peeling away
Languish in your own decay
descriptions of my killings
bone chilling

Terror, tear, her
Virgin cunt

Virgins are my victims
Their tight interiors I explore
Sharpened utensils of torture
Now inserted inside of her
Sex organs extracted for eating
On her liver I am gnawing

Forbidden lust for guts
Ripped from her cunt
Tears of blood cry down her thigh

I ram my fist inside her hole
From her crotch piss now flows
Rectum filled with shit
I fucked her emptied body
Until she became stiff

                    Â
