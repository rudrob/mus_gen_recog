                    Hateful I'm slashing, the head is removed 
removing the head of the corpse 
the throat down the hard chest the trunk is torn 
tearing the trunk of the corpse 

Disintegrating the stiff limb bylimb 
performing deviant butchery 
I chop up the limbs into small handy chunks 
in my own way of sick butchery 

I rip out the entrails, cut through pulsating flesh 
into the torso I grasp - deep - to tear out the rest 
I divide into that which I like and which not 
nutritious organs stored, the rest left to rot 

Wrathful I'm hacking the organs are minched 
minching the flesh of the stiff 
imagine the bodypared by sick culinary

                    Â
