                    Stop, be quiet now
I'll quit the light and
Then up and down it goes

Fly
I'll quit the light

There at the dawn
Inspiration i've looked for
spill it off, the youthful apears

Noone ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
I'ts make belive, make belive
Noone ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
One day it all will come to life

Step out of light and
I'll teach you how to fly then
The way we go
Leave your mind
Leave your mark in the land of mine

The second one to the riding man
Straight on untill morning light

Stop, be quiet now
No irritation
No not the slightest thought

We go at once quick
We'd better hurry
That from the rough sense the elven gets here

Enough of thoughts and imagination
Theese dreams will lift you up

What is it like you
Has been my dear?
Will there be fairies
Or things to fear?

For fairies sake I say you better come with me so soon you'll see
Now up and down it goes and round round and round and round
Tasting my criminous they all follow me
Our price to innocence, that's everything it needs

Fly in
Fly out
They leave it all behind

Noone ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
I'ts make belive, make belive
Noone ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
One day it all will come to life

Step out of light and
I'll teach you how to fly then
The way we go
Leave your mind
Leave your mark in the land of mine

Life is a mad time and it's quite confusing
The light surrender at the play begin
She flies, she flies into the light she flies
No one like just in mind

She's finding neverland there on the day she dies
Don't stop it now she still enjoys the scene
Don't stop it now
Don't stop it now
Don't stop it now
Don't stop it now now now

Noone ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
I'ts make belive, make belive
Noone ever dares to speak
It's nothing else but fantasy
One day it all will come to life

Step out of light and
I'll teach you how to fly then
The way we go
Leave your mind
Leave your mark in the land of mine
