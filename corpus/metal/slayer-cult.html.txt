                    Oppression is the holy law
 In God I distrust
 In time His monuments will fall
 Like ashes to dust
 It's war and greed the master plan?
 The bible's where it all began
 It's propaganda sells despair
 And spreads the virus everywhere

 Religion is hate
 Religion is fear
 Religion is war
 Religion is rape
 Religion is obscene
 Religion is a whore

 The pestilence of Jesus Christ
 There never was a sacrifice
 No man who hung the crucifix
 Beware the cult of purity
 Infectious imbecility
 I've made my choice
 666!

 Corruption breeds pedophile
 Don't pray for the priest
 Confession finds the lonely child
 God preys on the weak
 You think your soul can still be saved
 I think you're fucking miles away
 Scream out loud, heres where you begin
 Forgive me Father for I have sinned!

 Religion is hate
 Religion is fear
 Religion is war
 Religion is rape
 Religion is obscene
 Religion is a whore

 The target's fucking Jesus Christ
 I would've lead the sacrifice
 And nailed him to the crucifix
 Beware the cult of purity
 Infectious imbecility
 I've made my choice
 666!

 Jesus is pain
 Jesus is gore
 Jesus is the blood
 that's spilled in war
 He's everything
 He's all things dead
 He's pulling on the trigger
 pointed at your head!

 Through fear your sold into the fraud
 Revelation, 
 Revolution,
 I see through your Christ Illusion!

 The war on terror just drags along
 My war with God is growing strong
 His propaganda sells despair
 And spreads the violence everywhere!

 Religion is hate
 Religion is fear
 Religion is war
 Religion is rape
 Religion is obscene
 Religion is a whore

 There is no fuckin' Jesus Christ
 There never was a sacrifice
 No man upon the crucifix
 Beware the cult of purity
 Infectious their imbecility
 I've made my choice
 666!
