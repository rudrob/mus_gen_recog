One step towards The Sin of the Calf
Two steps away from God
High hills made low in the name of Greed
Infernal lust in heavenly robes

Come bask now
...in its sulphurous luster
...in its sulphurous glory

Molten vanity
Avaricious glory
Moldering pride
Measuring maggots
Overflowing with golden guilt
Narrow is the path out of damnation

One step away from the will of Heaven
Two steps towards The Pit
High heads made low in the name of Punishment
Unquenchable thirst in a river of flames

Come bask now
...in its sulphurous luster
...in its sulphurous glory

Metallic hunger
Altars of sin
Murderous shining lust
Magic stones of ruin
Overwhelming greed
Nectar of death
