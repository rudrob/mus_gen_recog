                    The river I'm bound to be found in,
A rope chosen bound for the hang
When I'm blinded I think I see everything
Convincing myself again

This god that I worship (A faded reflection)
This demon I blame (A flickering flame)
Conspire as one, exactly the same
It's exactly the same

Descending
To never recover the pieces
To all that we've lost
Recover the pieces lost
The pieces to all we've lost

I shudder to think of the consequence
It's blasphemy simple and true
The tragic protagonist torments
Convincing myself again

This god that I worship (A faded reflection)
This demon I blame (A flickering flame)
Conspire as one, exactly the same
It's exactly the same

Descending
To never recover the pieces
To all that we've lost
Recover the pieces lost
The pieces to all we've lost
