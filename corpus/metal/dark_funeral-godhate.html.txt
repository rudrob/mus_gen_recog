                    In the land of Israel, not too long ago.
A man sat in his prison cell, watching the moonlight.
They called him the king of Jews, but he had no crown.
All he had were his hope, for the coming of his Lord.
A Lord that isn't there when you are in need,
A lord so full of shit, you will die for his deeds.

Guilty or not, you're full of shit.
Spreading your lies that too many believes.
You are a fake, and I know the truth.
I know your name and your god I do hate.

When the moon fades away, the rise of sawn.
Our self-proclaimed king, he starts to cry.

Guilty, guilty!!!
You will die upon your cross, amongst the other thieves.
Guilty, guilty!!!
You will die upon your cross, amongst the other thieves.

The day has now arrived, and it is time for you to die.
Still blinded by stupidity, believing you are Christ.
Walking down the streets of Jerusalem,
covered in spit, from the people you loved.

Guilty or not, you're full of shit.
Spreading your lies that too many believes.
You are a fake, and I know the truth.
I know your name and your god I do hate.

Guilty, guilty!!
You will die upon your cross, amongst the other thieves.

In the land of Israel, not too long ago.
A fake sat in his prison cell, watching the moonlight.
They called him the king of Jews, but he was a clown.
And every nail through his flesh is delivered by me.

Guilty, guilty!!!
You will die upon your cross, amongst the other thieves.
