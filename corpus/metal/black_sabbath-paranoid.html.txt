                    Finished with my woman 'cause she
Couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane because
I am frowning all the time

All day long I think of things but
Nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I
Don't find something to pacify

Can you help me
Occup up my brain?
Oh yeah

I need someone to show me the
Things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true
Happiness I must be blind

Make a joke and I will sigh and
You will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel and
Love to me is so unreal

And so as you hear these words
Telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life 
I wish I could but it's too late

                    Â
