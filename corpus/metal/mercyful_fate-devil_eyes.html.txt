                    Angel, lady in white
Stay away, you know my forces

The devil eyes, devil eyes
Devil eyes, devil eyes

I'll take you to Hell, you're inside my spell
In Lucifer's mirror and I am his killer

I'm the Devil, I'm devil eyes

Angel, lady in white
You've had your time, now you are mine

Devil eyes, devil eyes
Devil eyes, devil eyes

I'll take you to Hell, you're inside my spell
In Lucifer's mirror and I am his killer

Oh yeah, I'm devil eyes, oh yeah, I love my devil eyes
Oh yeah, those evil eyes, oh yeah, I love my devil eyes

Well I'm devil eyes, I'm gonna get you

I am heading for the
The gates of Hell bringing a victim

She's angel eyes, angel eyes
Angel eyes, angel eyes

I took her to Hell in Lucifer's spell
Now I am his mirror and still I'm his killer
Still I'm his killer, well, I'm devil eyes

Devil eyes, devil eyes
Devil eyes, devil eyes
