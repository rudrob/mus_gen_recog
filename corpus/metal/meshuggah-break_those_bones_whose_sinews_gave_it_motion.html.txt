                    Tremors, reverberating
Frequency of doom
How strongly the violent thoughts of vengeance echo
Setting in motion the strings of hate.
Shudder
Shudder
Vibrate

This is the soundtrack to our hostility
To our malicious intent
To the pointless grudge forever held
The callow dream
The dismal wish to harm

Animate now
The twisted sounds of our disdain
Our rage
The notations to our contempt
To unforgiveness and loathing

A sonic declaration of spite and resentment
Its resonance grinding to dust our souls
The twine of revenge tightly strung.
Its sub harmonics, the undoing of all

So enticing
The retaliation - chords of man
The all-deafening - Oscillation of the damned

Let forth the hateful, the murderous
Let their malignant prayers resound
The reverberant, odious request
The wish of death abound

So enticing
The retaliation - chords of man
The all-deafening - Oscillation of the damned

                    Â
