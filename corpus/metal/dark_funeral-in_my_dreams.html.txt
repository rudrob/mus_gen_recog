                    When the moon is high in the heavens,
"And the sharp winds howl like wolves."

I lay in the darkness twisting and turning,
"My mind won't give me any peace"

I dream of when we were as one,
my secret passion in know to none.
If only I could turn back time,
"When your lips and heart they were only mine."

They were only mine...
......

Why do I think of our past together?
Your face haunts me - forever and ever
Dreaming of our time together
Your beuty haunts me, forever and ever

I dream of when we were as one, my secret passion is know to none
If only I could turn back time
"When on my erected pride you were sliding down"

You were sliding down...
......

Why do I think of our past together?
Your face haunts me - forever and ever
Dreaming of our time together
Your beuty haunts me, forever - and ever

"of all the glistening stars - you shine bringhest of them all."

Why do I dream of our past together?
Your face haunts me - forever and ever
Dreaming about our time together
Your beuty haunts me, forever - and ever

In my dreams we are still together
forever and ever...

Please let me sleep, forever - and ever

                    Â
