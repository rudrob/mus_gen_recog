                    Battlefields

Smell the battle with the wind
Before you see us
Winterhorde of fury ride
The wind will lead us
Banner high onword ride
Domestic purebred
Of the overlifted north sky

Conquer all permafrost
(Phantsmworlds)
Then wait at our final gate
Lay waste this world on ice
Let it crumble underneath us

Hide the breeze of better times
Where there are enemies to die
High flame and honour
Von on the fields of battle
Warriors fight
With longswords in hand
Valleys drink from the open wounds
Of a thousand men
Hear the battle on the wind
So obvious
Winterhorde of fury ride
The wind now lead us
Banners high onword ride
Domestic purebred
Of the everlifted north sky

Conquer all permafrost
(Phantsmworlds)
Then wait at our final gate
Lay waste this world on ice
It will crumble underneath us

Valleys drink from the open wounds
Of a thousand men
Eldrich talons eat hearts out of the fallen

Proud with battlelust we ride
Savagely towards the battlefields
And into greater strides

                    Â
