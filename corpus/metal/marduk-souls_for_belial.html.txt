                    Sweet torrents of Death
Oh engulfing ruin
Every fall is a soul
...for Belial

In sinless guilt rushing
Blasts of yokeless glory
To and fro - Red ascension
Collecting souls

...for Belial
...for Belial

And as our voice uncovers
Another soul to the stream
Another soul devoured
...for Belial

Oh Lawless Angel we approach thee
In the form of proudest shame
We thy children - Here assembled
Now thy promised blessing claim
...promised blessing claim

Lord of Arrogance - Lord of Pride
Fling thy unrestrained nets thrice
And let The Rivers of the under world
Swiftly to the surface rise

Oh Spirit of Darkness we invoke thee
In the name of all things depraved
We thy servants - here forgathered
Now thy promised blessing claim
...promised blessing claim

Sweet torrents of Death
Oh engulfing ruin
Every fall is a soul
...for Belial

...for Belial
...for Belial

Angels of sweed
Ever rising decline
Every slip is a soul
...for Belial

...for Belial
...for Belial

In sinless guilt rushing
Blasts of yokeless glory
To and fro - Red ascension
Collecting souls

...for Belial
...for Belial

And as our voice uncovers
Another soul to the stream
Another soul devoured
...for Belial

                    Â
