                    Closer, come closer till everything burns
Each fetus a torch
The missionaries&#65533; lips in raging flames
Death and our semen, at last shall we burn
Ash and coal
Come closer, come closer
Ash and coal
The guilty and the innocent the same
Light razorblades restless dance
Our navel-strings and forgotten sins
Ash and coal
Holy or crown of lust&#65533; the city must burn
The bread and the flesh must follow its vow
The abdomen, tongues and aborted the same
Every image of both living and dead
Shall perish in flames
Perish in flames
Perish in flames
Perish!
Come, come closer till nothing breathe
Come closer,
And come without warning
The prophet&#65533;s&#65533; ash and coal
Blind, but with a thousand seeking arms
Ash and coal&#65533;
Can you outrun the mouths of hell?
Holy or crown of lust&#65533;
The city must burn
The bread and the flesh must follow its vow
The abdomen, tongues and aborted the same
Every image of both living and dead&#65533;
Holy or throne of filth&#65533;

All nations must burn
The king and the whore together at last
The abdomen, tongues and seeker the same
Every fragment of both tomb and tree
Shall perish in flames
Perish in flames
Perish in flames
Perish in flames&#65533;
