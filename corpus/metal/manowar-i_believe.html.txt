From the darkness I walk into the lights 
From the day I walk into the nights 
From the shadows I will appear 
With a message for all who will hear 

For the weak of heart 
I will be strong 
To the defenders of faith 
I will belong 
Till the last of us fight till we die 
Till the keys of the kingdom are mine 

All stand together for the world to see 
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams 
Say the words forever your strength will never leave 
If you want to win the fight say I believe 

From the darkness I walk into the light 
From the day I walk into the night 
From the shadows I will appear 
With a message for all who will hear 

For the weak of heart 
I will be strong 
To the defenders of faith 
I will belong 
Till the last of us fight till we die 
Till the keys of the kingdom are mine 
Lets all stand together for the world to see 
Now the time is right to live out all our dreams 
Say the words forever your strength will never leave 
If you want to win the fight say I believe 

If you want to win tonight 
Say I believe
