                    Here I am, back to the wall,
I pick the fight against the tide,
Free at last I go my own way,
I will resist them, till the day I die,
I am who I am; my time has come!

I am who I am, take it or leave it,
A rebel at heart!
No gods, no masters,
My time has come.

There is no sacred place,
No perfect world,
Your head is home,
Freedom in your heart,
Be strong; take this chance,
Make your way; a better future calls.
I am who I am; my time has come.

I am who I am, take it or leave it,
A rebel at heart!
No gods, no masters,
My time has come.
No gods, no masters,
No gods, no masters,

What doesn’t kill us makes us stronger.
Locked and loaded ready to strike,
Here we stand- loud and proud, 
United as one. United as one.

I am who I am, take it or leave it,
A rebel at heart!
No gods, no masters,
My time has come.

I am who I am, take it or leave it,
A rebel at heart!
No gods, no masters,
My time has come.
