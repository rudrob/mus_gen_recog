                    Killers

I'm so tough, hear my motor revving up
Who yeah, keep on and take it away
Well hold tight it's Saturday night
Sorry but I just can't fade, no way
We're gonna shake it loose party all night
She got my number but that's alright
Killers, runnin' loose

We'll case the whole town
I know she's been around
She's got me running that's for sure
Yeah so knocked up, bad girls lick it up
They got the jump boys
And there ain't no cure
We're gonna make it loose shake it in the air
Their mamas coming but we don't care
Killers, running loose
Killers, running loose

I'm gonna cut it loose show 'em what we've got
Party all night long ain't never gonna stop
Thank you killers, runnin' loose
And we're killers, runnin' loose
