                    To see the interior of a dark coffin
What is it like to be inside dead..?
Is there something I might perceive,
Or is it just infinity...?
Viley maggots swarm within stale pus,
Accelerating rate of putridity...
Thought patterns preserved in energetic form
Or is it lost, lost in infinity...? ...Fierce...

Is there something that I might live,
Or is it all lost in nothingness...?

Weakened tissue starts rapidly to degrade
Under progressive foulness, former vital organs
Are replaced by a clumb of corpse tumors
Is that what expects us in the deep -
Just corpse tumors...?
