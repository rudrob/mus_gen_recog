                    Snorting - the viley stench of putrescence 
Coffin - lies exhumed in front of me 
Foul stiff - strewn with papillae and pores 
Formenting - stiff corpse putrefies 

Slicing, bisecting, incising the stiff 

Stomach wall is opening 
primitive diagnosis... 
remove internal organs 
primitive autopsy... 

Sawing - the weak head of the corpse I saw 
Slicing - celebral bisection 
Eviscerate - slushy bowels ripped out at once 
Perfecting - foul body autopsy
