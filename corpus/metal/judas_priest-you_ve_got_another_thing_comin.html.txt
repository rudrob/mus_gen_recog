                    One life I'm gonna live it up 
I'm takin' flight said I'll never get enough. 
Stand tall I'm young and kinda proud 
I'm on top as long as the music's loud. 
If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by 
You're thinkin' like a fool 'cause it's a case of do or die. 
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had 
If you think I'll let it go you're mad 
You've got another thing comin'. 

That's right here's where the talkin' ends 
Well listen this night there'll be some action spent. 
Drive hard I'm callin' all the shots 
I got an ace card comin' down on the rocks. 

If you think I'll sit around while you chip away my brain 
Listen I ain't foolin' and you'd better think again. 
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had 
If you think I'll let it go you're mad 
You've got another thing comin'. 
In this world we're livin' in we have our share of sorrow 
Answer now is don't give in aim for a new tomorrow. 

Oh so hot no time to take a rest yeah 
Act tough ain't room for second best. 
Real strong got me some security 
Hey I'm a big smash I'm goin' for infinity yeah.
