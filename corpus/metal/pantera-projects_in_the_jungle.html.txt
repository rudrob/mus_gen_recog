I come from the jungle
I'm free from the trade
No one can stop me
I'm panic, I'm brave

I am the one there
That had no shame
No one mock me
I played my game

Can you hear it?
Call of the wild
Hey man, it's screamin'
Driving me wild

Projects in the jungle
Projects in the jungle
Projects in the jungle
Projects in the jungle

Here to my eyes
I'm bad as hell
Run like the tiger
That's playin' the bell

I am hunger
Look in my stare
I'm not a human
I'm a beast in bed

Can you hear it?
Call of the wild
Hey man, it's screamin'
I'm going wild

Projects in the jungle
Projects in the jungle
Projects in the jungle
Projects

Projects in the jungle
Projects in the jungle
Projects in the jungle
Projects

Ha!
