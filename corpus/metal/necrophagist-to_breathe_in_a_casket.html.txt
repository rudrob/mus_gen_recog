                    Eyes opened up within the moist and dark
Trapped inside the measures of a coffin
Horrified awakening, blank fears embrace me

Oh... beyond...
Beyond these walls there lies infinity...

Asphyxiation is imminent 
Due to the measures of this confinement,
Blind hits against the coffin walls,
Blank fears control me

Oh... beyond...
Beyond these walls there lies infinity...

To breathe in a casket - six feet below
To breathe in a casket - below

Buried deep beneath the earth, beneath the earth
Blank fears embrace me, embrace me
Buried deep six feet below, six feet below
Blank fears control me, control me

Breathing inside of a casket
Breathing inside of a casket
Breathe

Eyes opened up within the moist and dark
Trapped inside the measures of a coffin
Horrified awakening, blank fears embrace me

Oh... beyond...
Beyond these walls there lies infinity...

Asphyxiation is imminent 
Bue to the measures of this confinement,
Blind hits against the coffin walls,
Blank fears control me

Oh... beyond...
Beyond these walls there lies infinity...

To breathe in a casket - six feet below
To breathe in a casket - below

Breathe

                    Â
