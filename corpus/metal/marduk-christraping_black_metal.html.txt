                    Nailed to the cross while the weak
Overcome with grief weep and mourn
To pervert the mind of the following sheep sould
You scourge was born
As a shepherd of the inferior rats
You knew what to do
But spears and steel of your opponents
Could hurt your body too

As the torncrowned jester you enchanted the scum without skill
And now the strong ones move in for the kill

Smashing your face
Crushing your race
Christraping black metal to Satan gives praise

Breaking your bones
Scorning your moans
Your powers is ceasing with a parting groan

Christraping black metal

The daughters of satan abuses your body
And drool in ecstasy when you die
While our warriors rips the beard
Of your idiot father halls up high

Smashing your face
Crushing your race
Christraping black metal to Satan gives praise

Spilling your blood
Killing your god
The ripped and torn angels will bleed like a flood

Your cross shuld stand as a monument
For people to fear and obey
The evil truth is that your foundation
Is a shell made of clay

Scratched and torn by the devilish whores
Your filthy carcass will reek
Let us ride all the nightmares and fears of the church
And perish the holy and weak

Smashing your face
Crushing your race
Christraping black metal to Satan gives praise

Screams from your soul
As it turns black as coal
And falls through the pits of the abyss's black hole

The fallen son of god has failed
The ending so far away from your goal
And the souls of the future witch the light can't deceive
Their fate is written in my soul

Smashing your face
Crushing your race
Christraping black metal to Satan gives praise

Spilling your blood
Killing your god
The ripped and torn angels will bleed like a flood

Christraping black metal
