                    Beyond The North Waves

On many ships we have sailed
Far beyond the north waves
On the high northern seas
We have found our way
The shadowing voices of our gods
Singing on the calling winds...
Where the cold waves and the longboats brought us far
The saga of the warriors from northland
Speaks of greatness and strength
The saga of the warriors from northland
Are the saga of many great a man

On seas against the open
We travelled on and on
Through the raging winds
And storms we arrived
The shadowing voices of our gods
Singing on the calling wind...
Where the cold waves and the longboats brought us far
With sword in hand I now stand
On my enemies land
With a northern heart
I will fight until the day I die

My time will be remembered my time it will be known
By my sons by my tribe and by the sun the sea and moon

For the who battle for his land his pride and for his men
Shall be remembered and stand eternally named
In the legends of our land

Breathing in winds...
From the essence of a roaring horizon
Breathing in winds...
From the cold sea call the shores of the north

                    Â
