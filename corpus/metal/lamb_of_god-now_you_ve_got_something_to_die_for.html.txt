                    Now you've got something to die for
Now you've got something to die for
Infidel, Imperial
Lust for blood, a blind crusade
Apocalyptic, we count the days

Bombs to set the people free, blood to feed the dollar tree
Flags for coffins on the screen, oil for the machine
Army of liberation, gunpoint indoctrination
The fires of sedation
Fulfill the prophecy

Now you've got something to die for
Now you've got something to die for

Send the children to the fire, sons and daughters stack the pyre
Stoke the flame of the empire, live to lie another day
Face of hypocrisy, raping democracy
Apocalyptic, we count the days

We'll never get out of this hole, until we've dug our own grave
And drag the rest down with us, the burning home of the brave
Burn
Now you've got something to die for
Now you've got something to die for

                    Â
