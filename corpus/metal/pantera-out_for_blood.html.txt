                    Out For Blood

Uh!

Dropped down to the bathroom floor
She made me even scream for more

Baby, want some action this year?

Pulse said yes, it didn't say no
It's on the thing just go go go

And you know what I mean

She just can't stop
You can't tell her no no no no
She's got the antidote
She never gets enough

She's out for blood
She's out for blood

Driving all the young men crazy
And you know she loves it baby

We were talkin' 'bout her what a down

In my mind it's all the ass go
Where all the back up go

Don't you know she's dealin' with you now?

She just can't stop
You can't tell her no no no no
She's got the antidote
She never gets enough

She's out for blood, she's out for blood
She's out for blood, she's out for blood

Yeah!

Hey!

If you're lookin' for someone
Lookin' out for number one

She can show you where to go

Her experience she's learned
What she's got, she's got a lot

Burning down fire down the hall

She just can't stop
You can't tell her no no no no
She's got the antidote
She never gets enough

She wants some... blood!

She's out for blood
She's out for blood
She's out for blood
She's out for blood
