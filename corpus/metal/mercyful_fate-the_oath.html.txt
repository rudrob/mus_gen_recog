                    By the Symbol of the Creator, I swear
henceforth to be
A faithful Servant of his most puissant
Arch-Angel
The Prince Lucifer
Whom the Creator designated as His
Regent
And Lord of this World, Amen.
I deny Jesus Christ, the Deceiver
And I abjure the Christian Faith
Holding in contempt all of it's Works
Solo: M.D. Solo: H.S.
As a Being now possessed of a human Body
In this World I swear to give my full
Allegiance
To it's lawful Master, to worship Him
Our Lord Satan, and no other
In the name of Satan, the ruler of Earth
Open wide the Gates of Hell and come forth
from the Abyss
By these Names: Satan, Leviathan, Belial,
Lucifer
I will kiss the Goat
Solo: H.S. Solo: M.D.
I swear to give my mind, my Body and
Soul unreservedly
To the Furtherance of our Lord Satan's
Designs
Do What Thou Wilt, Shall Be The Whole Of
The Law
As it was in the Beginning, is now, and
ever shall be
World without End, Amen.
Solo: H.S. - M.D.
