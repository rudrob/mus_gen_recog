                    Leaves fall in the autumn 
Of lives that appear 
To be worthless to some, 
Utmost ignorant. 

Expectations shift in the eye 
of the beholder...behold 

Tears drop from the eye 
Of lives paled 
As jealousy fools 
A mind distorted 

Expectations shift in the eye 
Of the beholder...behold' 

One wishes existence 
To be of fulfillment, 
But leaves bend to the will 
Of winds blowing 

To foresee the end of a soul...Epitaph 

Claim to foresee 
The end of a soul. 
Prematue Epitaph. 

To foresee the end 
Of a soul... Epitaph
