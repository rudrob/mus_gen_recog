                    [by Neil Young]

My cinnamon girl
My cinnamon girl.

I wanna live with a cinnamon girl,
I could be happy the rest of my life.

A dreamer of pictures I run in the night,
You see us together chase the moonlight,

My cinnamon girl.
My cinnamon girl.

Ten silver saxes, a bass with a bow,
The drummer relaxes and waits between shows.

A dreamer of pictures I run in the night
You see us together, chase the moonlight,

My cinnamon girl.
My cinnamon girl.

Pa sent me money now
I'm gonna make it somehow
I need another chance,
You see your baby loves to dance
Yeah...yeah...yeah.

My cinnamon girl.
My cinnamon girl
