                    Voices, they are calling my name.
They never stop and it drives me insane.
Even in sleep they torment my soul,
my inner demons take all control.

Slowly it's transforming me into a beast,
nails turn to claw and I got white fangs as teeth.

The hundreds of voices inside my head,
they will only stop the day I am dead.

Voices oh voices leave me alone,
why are you inside me and torment my soul.
Why don't you leave and let me be,
demons inside get out I beg thee.

666 voices inside, telling me who's about to die.
They are in control of my mind.
666 demons inside, to kill them all only one must die.
It is a shame it must be me...

What have I done to deserve this hell,
am I better off dead or locked up in a padded cell.
I feel the demons bloodlust slowly increase,
saying that next murder must be a masterpiece.

Voices oh voices leave me alone,
why are you inside me and torment my soul.
Why don't you leave and let me be,
demons inside get out I beg thee.

666 voices inside, telling me that this one must die.
They are in control of my mind.
666 demons inside, I hear them rejoice when someone dies.
But I am the one with blood on my hands.

666 voices inside, telling me who's about to die.
They are in control of my mind.
666 demons inside, to kill them all only one must die.
It is a shame it must be me...

666 voices inside, telling me it is your turn to die.
They are in control of my mind
666 demons inside; I hear them rejoice now when you die.

A deed I commit, with a smile...}
