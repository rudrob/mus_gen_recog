                    The only thing I ever wanted, the only thing I ever needed 
is my own way - I gotta have it all 
I don't want your opinion, I don't need your ideas 
stay the f**k out of my face, stay away from me 
I am my god - I do as I please 

just wipe your own ass and - shut your mouth 

I had enough and you're going down - shut your mouth 
what comes around you know goes around 

my mind is playing tricks on me 
I am not as stable as I used to be 
pushed and shoved, you know you're going too far 
I will not break my back for you no more, I am gonna go my 
way 
I am gonna take control 
time to wake up and dig myself out of this hell 

just wipe your own ass and - shut your mouth 

I had enough and you're going down - shut your mouth 
what comes around you know goes around - shut your mouth 
you're getting what your ego deserves - shut your mouth 
what comes around you know goes around - shut your mouth 

shut your mouth 

I had enough and you're going down - shut your mouth 
what comes around you know goes around 

shut your mouth 
shut your mouth 
shut your mouth
