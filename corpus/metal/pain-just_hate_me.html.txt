                    I gotta think of something 
to make you think less 
of me, that I am nothing 
to hold on to, cause we are through 
I dislike you 

I wish that you could hate me 
then things would be so easy 
just get me off your mind 
if the bitch would have a son 
then I would be the one 
so hate me 

geese, flying from the winter 
that's what I should do, do, do 
or become a sprinter 
and run away 
cause we are through 
I dislike you 

I wish that you could hate me 
then things would be so easy 
just get me off your mind 
if the bitch would have a son 
then I would be the one 

I am being mean 
like no one's ever been 
just hate me... 

I wish that you could hate me 
then things would be so easy 
just get me off your mind...
