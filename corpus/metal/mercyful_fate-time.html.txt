                    Minutes and seconds are passing us by
Minutes and seconds are passing us by
Time... Time
Minutes and seconds are passing us by
Time... Time
Time... Time... Time is always passing by
Doesn't matter where you are
Time is passing us by
What a beautiful moment
If you're willing to trade
Then I'll give you a moment of mine
Give you a moment of mine
Minutes and seconds are passing us by
Minutes and seconds are passing us by
Minutes and seconds are passing us by
(Time will never stand still)
Minutes and seconds are passing us by
Minutes and seconds are passing us by
(Time will never stand still)
Time... Time... Time is always passing by
Doesn't matter where you are
Time is passing us by
What a beautiful moment
If we took it away
We could use it on some other day
Use it on some other day
Time is here, Time is now
Time is here, Time is now
Time will kill... Time will heal
Time will come and go away
But time will never stay... Time will kill
Time will heal... Time will kill
Minutes and seconds are passing us by...
