                    Come into this night 
Here we'll be gone 
So far away 
From our weak and crumbling lives 
Come into this night 
When days are done 
Lost and astray 
In what's vanished from your eyes 

What came and distorted your sight 
Saw you benighted by your fright 

Come into this night 
Your plight alone 
Carry your weight 
You are flawed as all of us 
Come into this night 
You only home 
It's never too late 
To repent, suffer the loss 

What came and distorted your sight 
Saw you benighted by your fright 

What came and distorted your sight 
Saw you benighted by your fright 

Come into this night 
When you're able 
To undo your deeds 
And atone with your lonely soul 
Once you're into this night 
All minds are stable 
Forget all your needs 
Lose the grip of all control
