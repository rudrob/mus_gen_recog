                    Fist in the face for the time smothered angel
By Satan my scythe will shallow every hallow
Open now dear blood soaked soil
By Satan I pour magma down throat.

Come ghostfaced hungry shadows of shadows
By Satan I drink the darkness they drewl
With victorious weapons
I will melt every angels wings

Triumph of the will striking
Striking to kill

Cloak the earth with a thousand nights
And a billion dead
We toast and drink from and chalice
Filled with shreds of life
And know my eyes are knifes
To shred every fucking stream
Of Christian light

                    Â
