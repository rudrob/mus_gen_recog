                    Imagine you were at my station
And you brought your motor to me
You're a burner, yeah a real motor car
Said you wanna get your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do, ya know, lucky for you

Who'd ever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me?
I do it for my life
You made my drive shaft crank
You made by pistons buldge
You made my bearings melt from the heat

We were shifting hard when we took off
Put, tonight, all four on the floor
When we hit top end ya know it feels too slow
Said you wanna get your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do, ya know, lucky for you

Who'd ever though you'd be better
At turning a screw than me?
I do it for my life
You made my drive shaft crank
You made by pistons buldge
You made my bearings melt from the heat

I'm giving you my room service
And ya know it's more than enough
Oh more more time ya know I'm in love
Said you wanna get your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do, ya know, lucky for you

Who'd ever though you'd be better
At turning a screw than me?
I do it for my life
FUCK YEAH!
You made my drive shaft crank
You made by pistons buldge
You made my bearings melt from the heat
