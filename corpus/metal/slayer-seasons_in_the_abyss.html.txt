                    Razors edge outlines the dead
Incisions in my head
Anticipation the stimulation
To kill the exhilaration

[CHORUS 1]
Close your eyes
Look deep in your soul
Step outside yourself
And let your mind go
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind 
as you die

[CHORUS 2]
Close your eyes
And forget your name
Step outside yourself
And let your thoughts drain
As you go insane... go insane

Innate seed to watch you bleed
A demanding physical need
Desecrated eviscerated
Time perpetuated

[CHORUS 1]
[CHORUS 2]


Inert flesh a bloody tomb
A decorated splatter brightens the room
An execution a sadist ritual
Mad intervals of mind residuals

[CHORUS 1]
[CHORUS 2]

                    Â
