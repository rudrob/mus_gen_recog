All alone
This lonely night
I've been thinkin' about you
And I'm on my own
Just ain't right
Well I don't know where I'm gonna go

I can't take it
I can't make it alone
No

I'm in over my head
Thought it would be easy or not
But it's harder instead
I'm in over my head
Over my head
Without you

I can't sleep
I need your touch
Lying here right beside me
I was in too deep
Meant too much
Something free that reminds me

I can't take it
I can't make it alone
No

I'm in over my head
Thought it would be easy or not
But it's harder instead
I'm in over my head
Over my head
Without you

I keep thinkin' love is gonna find a way
I feel it comin' love will find a way

I'm in over my head
Thought it would be easy or not
But it's harder instead
I'm in over my head
Over my head
Without you

I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head

Over my head

Over

Over
