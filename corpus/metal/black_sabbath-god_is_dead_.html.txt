                    Lost in the darkness,
I fade from the light
Faith of my father, my brother, my maker and savior.
Help me make it through the night.
Blood on my conscience
And murder in mind.
Out of the gloom I rise up from my tomb into impending doom.
Now my body is my shrine.

The blood runs free,
The rain turns red.
Give me the wine,
You keep the bread.
The voices echo in my head.
Is God alive or is God dead?
Is God dead?

Rivers of evil
Run through dying land.
Swimming in sorrow, they kill steal and borrow. There is no tomorrow.
For the sinners will be damned.
Ashes to ashes,
You cannot exhume a soul.
Who do you trust when corruption and lust, creed of all the unjust,
Leaves you empty and unwhole?

When will this nightmare be over? Tell me!
When can I empty my head?
Will someone tell me the answer?
Is God really dead?
Is God really dead?

To safeguard my philosophy
Until my dying breath
I transfer from reality
Into a living death
I empathize with enemies
Until the time is right
With God and Satan at my side,
From darkness will come light

I watch the rain
And it turns red
Give me more wine
I don’t need bread
These riddles that live in my head
I don’t believe that God is dead
God is dead

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Wondering if we will meet again
On the other side
Do you believe a word
what the Good Book said?
Or is it just a holy fairytale
And God is dead?
God is Dead x4

Right!

But still the voices in my head
Are telling me that god is dead
The blood pours down
The rain turns red
I don’t believe that God is dead
God is Dead x3
