                    In the corner beside my window 
Hangs a lonely photograph 
There is no reason 
I'd never notice 
A memory that could hold me back 

There is a wound that's always bleeding 
There is a road I'm always walking 
And I know you'll never return to this place 

Gone through days without talking 
There is a comfort in silence 
So used to losing all ambition 
Struggling to maintain what's left 

Once undone, there is only smoke 
Burning in my eyes to blind 
To cover up what really happened 
Force the darkness unto me
