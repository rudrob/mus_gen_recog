                    You don't believe in what I'm doing
How much more do i have to prove you?
I can't give up what I've started
I'm not a quitter this is what i do.

LIAR

Can you look in my eyes
without telling me a bunch of lies
all I asked for was the truth
I thought it was me, but now i know it's you.

LIAR

ref.
I'm going in
into the fire , I'm burning you out
I'm going in
I'm cooling down your skin


Do you like how I treat you
or should I treat you like a movie star
something good just went so bad
I got to bring you down.

ref.x2

Dream on little liar
truth will call out your name.
