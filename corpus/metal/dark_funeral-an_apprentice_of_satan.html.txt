                    A darkened place beyond the eternal death, 
Hung many victims chained lifeless. 
Stolen of all their dignity. 
The dried blood on her pale skin, 
Witness her beliefs. 
She's an apprentice of Satan. 
The wind is blowing strong from the north. 
While the demons force their way through the flames, 
To grant her with their wisdom wide. 
Inside the circle she feels safe. 
She can feel the power grow. 

She's an apprentice of Satan. 

A sigh echoes through the woods. 
Like a winter storm it spread through the maze. 
When she's finally embraced by the darkness. 
That she has finally welcomed into her…life!!! 

The wind, cold as the full moon high in the darkened sky. 
Carries a weak fragrance of blood. 
She can hear the demons call out her name. 
Whispers in the shadows, evil forces everywhere. 
The wind is blowing strong in the north. 
While the demons force their way through the flames,
To grant her with eternal life. 
She's the evil messenger of Satanic beliefs. 
She's an apprentice of Satan…. 

High in the sky flies the evil apprentice. 
She has turned to the dark side. 
With her beauty and her power of Satan. 
She consumes the dead to get more life. 

High above all, stands our evil apprentice. 
Now seduced by the dark side. 
With the power of Satan, 
She will never see the dawn until the end of time. 

A darkened place beyond the eternal death, 
Hung many victims chained lifeless. 
Stolen of all their dignity. 
The dried blood on her pale skin witness her beliefs. 
She's an apprentice of Satan. 

She's an evil apprentice.
