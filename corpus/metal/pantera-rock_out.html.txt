                    Gonna rock it in the evenin'
Lovin' in the morning
I'm gonna show that girl
I can hear her callin' now
What can I do?
I need to get through to you
I've fallen in too deep

Good lovin'
And I'm in love
Good rockin'
She gave me all she got

Sweet darlin'
Can you feel the
again
No, not my girl
It's goin' down
You know I really love it girl
You do it oh so right

Good lovin'
And I'm in love
Good rockin'
She gave me all she got

Uh-oh
I said rock out!
Rock out you know
I said rock out
Rock out
Rock out with your
Rock out (rock out)
Come on, lose that top!

-Solo-

Rock you midnight
daylight
I need to hold that girl
Right here, tonight
What can I do?
I need to get through to you
I've fallen in too deep

Good lovin'
And I'm in love
Good rockin'
She gave me all she got

One more time
I said rock out!
Rock out you know
Rock out
I said rock out
Rock out
Rock out with your
Rock out (rock out)
Come on, come on!

-Solos-

Rock out

-Solo-

(Ooh what a headache)
