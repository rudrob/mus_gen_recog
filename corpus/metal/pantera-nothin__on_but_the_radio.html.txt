                    She looks easy
a real lady
she knows what i need
she's kinda easy
she's everything you ever wanted in a girl
i'm in love with the way she walks
and i'm not the kinda guy who talks
late at night she gives it everything that she's got
she's got
nothin' on but the radio
late at night, that's the only way to go
nothin' on but the radio
she loves dancin'
slow dancin'
walk me away
sweet romancin'
that little girl
she knows how to satisfy man
i love her every way
tell her what i need
she'll always do ya
and always say please
oh that lil girl she's got
she's got
nothin' on but the radio
nothin' on but the radio

when i feel the way
that i feel about you girl
so easy
when i'm feelin' the way that i do
you're likely to know
whoa

She looks easy
a real lady
she knows what i need
she's kinda easy
she's everything you ever wanted in a girl
i'm in love with the way she walks
and i'm not the kinda guy who talks
late at night she gives it everything that she's got
she's got
nothin' on but the radio
late at night, that's the only way to go
nothin' on but the radio
