                    Revolution in their minds - the children start to march 
Against the world they have to live in 
Oh! the hate that's in their hearts 
They're tired of being pushed around 
and told just what to do 
They'll fight the world until they've won 
and love comes flowing through 
Yeah!

Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today 
Will the sunrise of tomorrow bring in peace in any way 
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear 
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear? 
Yeah!

So you children of the world listen to what I say 
If you want a better place to live in spread 
the world today 
Show the world that love is still alive you must be brave 
Or your children of today are children of the grave
Yeah!

                    Â
