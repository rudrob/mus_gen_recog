                    Loving the dead
A torso, a hand or a severed head
The cemetery girls don't say no to their fate
When their bodies get too rotten
Their skeletons do great

Lurking in the shadows with you on my mind
I'm engulfed by your beauty
I'm a man who's gone blind
Watching you move so graceful this night
I'm going to catch you, how I long for this fight
Smelling your hair as I'm working my knife
I adore how you scream when I take your life

How I love your pale white skin
And the emptiness in your lifeless eyes
And how I love the warmth within
Like the blood that sprayed
When you stopped your cries

Your naked corpse is as beautiful
As the dawn when it comes with the first sunray
But it was your peeled bleached bones
That really took my breath away

Admiring your beauty my wonderful rose
Oh what pleasures you'll give me
Before you decompose
But the darkness has fallen and the clock strikes ten
Excuse me my darling but the shadows
Are calling again

How I love your pale white skin
And the emptiness in your lifeless eyes
And how I love the warmth within
Like the blood that the sprayed
When you stopped your cries

Your naked corpse is as beautiful
As the dawn when it comes with the first sunray
But it was your peeled bleached bones
That really blew my mind away

How I love your pale white skin
And the emptiness in your lifeless eyes
And how I love the warmth within
Like the blood that sprayed
When you stopped your cries

Your naked corpse is as beautiful
As the dawn when it comes with the first sunray
But it was your peeled bleached bones
That really stole my heart away
