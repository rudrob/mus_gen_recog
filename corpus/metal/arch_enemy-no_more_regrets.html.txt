                    You chose your path
Don't shift the blame
You ran your course
You lost sight of your aim

Wrong choices linger
Like scars remain
Long after the bleeding stops
There's nowhere left to hide
From the shame

Never again

No, no more regrets
What's done is done
Can't be erased
Know, know your regrets
Savour the bitter aftertaste

The cripping guilt
How heavy it can be
When searching for the right words
Hoping the truth will bring you peace

A lesson learned is good company
For the lonely road you walk
Each step forward, agony

Never again

No, no more regrets
What's done is done
Can't be erased
Know, know your regrets
Savour the bitter aftertaste

It's hard to breathe
Thought processes crushing me
Purge mistakes
Strip the mind of its dignity

Liar, liar

Never again

No, no more regrets
What's done is done
Can't be erased
Know, know your regrets
Savour the bitter aftertaste

What's done is done
Can't be erased
All I know is but regret
I can't shake this bitter aftertaste
