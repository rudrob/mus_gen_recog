                    Dismembering - to chop her body I begin 
Bastard - bastard inside 
Disfiguring - abdominal wall is opening 
Offal - come to sight 

Malintention, to chop the foetus I intent, hateful am I 
vile malodours, rancid odours I percieve 
I'm getting high 

Hate and repulsion is that 
which strenghtens my intent 
fetal incising causes premature decease 
loathing am I to commit 
infanticide in unborn state 
to tear out the foetus, my aggressions do increase 

Mutilate the stillborn 

Dismanteling - excoriate the dead unborn 
Vile waste - vile waste inside is 
Festering - prenatal fluids I adore 
Offal - come to sight 

Mutilation, the stillborn body chopped in half 
hateful am I 
Disemboweling, 
the torso drained of tepid bowels 
I'm getting high
