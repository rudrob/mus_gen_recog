                    B.Y.O.B. - Bring your own bombs

Why do they always send the poor?! 

Barbarisms by Barbaras with pointed heels 
Victorious victories kneel for brand new spankin' deals 
Marching forward hypocrite and hypnotic computers 
You depend on our protection 
Yet you feed us lies from the tablecloth 

Everybody's going to the party have a real good time 
Dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine 

Kneeling roses disappearing into Moses' dry mouth 
Breaking into Fort Knox stealing our intentions 
Hangers sitting dripped in oil 
Crying freedom 
Handed to absolution 
Still you feed us lies from the tablecloth 

Everybody's going to the party have a real good time 
Dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine  (all x2)

Blast off 
It's party time 
And we don't live in a fascist nation 
Blast off 
It's party time 
And where the fuck are you? 

Where the fuck are you?  x2
Why don't presidents fight the war? 
Why do they always send the poor? 
Why don't presidents fight the war? 
Why do they always send the poor?  x4

Kneeling roses disappearing into Moses' dry mouth 
Breaking into Fort Knox stealing our intentions 
Hangers sitting dripped in oil 
Crying freedom 
Handed to absolution 
Still you feed us lies from the tablecloth

Everybody's going to the party have a real good time 
Dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine 
Everybody's going to the party have a real good time 
Dancing in the desert blowing up the sun

Where the fuck are you?  x2
Why don't presidents fight the war? 
Why do they always send the poor? 
Why don't presidents fight the war? 
Why do they always send the poor?  x6
They always send the poor  x2
