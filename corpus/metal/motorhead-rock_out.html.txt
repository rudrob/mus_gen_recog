                    Hear the music coming, loud as you can stand,
You will never be the same again,
Let the beat into you. Let it turn you 'round,
Let it be your best friend,
You are the future, it's your time,
You and you and you,
Stay together this is yours and mme,
What we're gonna do.

(First chorus)
Rock out, rock out, rock out.
Let it crush your fear,
Rock out, rock out, rock out.
And you can get it here!

Here comes the bass, thunder in the guts,
Rock 'til you can't stand.
How the guitar speaks. gonna drive you nuts,
Power underyour hand,
You are the people, now you shine,
You and you and you,
Stay together, let me speak the line,
What you gonna do?

(Second chorus)
Rock out rock out rock out
Let it crush your fear,
Rock out rock out rock out
You can get it here

(Third chorus)
Rock out, rock out, with your cock out.
Impress your lady friends,
Rock out, rock out. rock out,
'Til your life is at an end.
