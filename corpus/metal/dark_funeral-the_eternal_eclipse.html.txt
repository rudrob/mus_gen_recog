                    And since the day I left
the burning fields of the abyss
I've been alone
and wandering through the world in darkness
I've never thought of turning back
and every step I take
is leading me towards my final breath of air
I was alive to see the world
erupt in flames and brimstone
as the judgement day swept clean all the lands
Humanity was doomed to die
and the remnants that were left,
they would forever hide in shame

Towards the end
The world will again
Deform and transcend
The eternal eclipse

As we reach the end
No man will again
Reform or amend
For the Apocalypse

And when the sun turned black all water froze to ice
and all remaining life was sent into the great unknown
I was alone, the king of kings but nothing was left there
to rule and nothing was there to destroy
I saw that day, that joyful day I conquered all
then walked away and now I'm waiting for my demise
Oh soon to come my glorius death
and I will be the last to leave
for the world will be returned to the night

Towards the end
My world will again
Deform and transcend
The eternal eclipse

As we reach the end, no man will again
Reform or amend for the Apocalypse

The world will again
Deform and transcend
The world will again...

The eternal eclipse

                    Â
