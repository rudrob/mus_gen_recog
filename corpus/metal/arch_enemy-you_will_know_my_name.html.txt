                    The judging eyes, watching me
It's all I've ever known
Every time I open up my heart
I am ridiculed, and torn apart
You tell jokes I'll never get to hear
Behind my back, at my expense

There's something inside me
I know it's good
I'm not evil, just misunderstood

Do you see me now?
Do you hear me now?
You will know my name
Do you see me now?
Do you fear me now?
You will know my name!

To try and break my silence
Strip you of your dignity
Tear down your perfect world
Your perfect lies!

No more jokes I'll never get to hear
Behind my back, at my expense

There's something inside me
I know it's good
I'm not evil, just misunderstood

Do you see me now?
Do you hear me now?
You will know my name
Do you see me now?
Do you fear me now?
You will know my name!

No longer invincible, you will know my name!
