                    A life free of guilt exists when 
The eye fights daylight yet unseen. 
A book with not a page written 
Means hope yet sometimes to be 

(The) Stillborn One. Born Dead. 
(The) Stillborn One. Dead. 

When dawn and sunset coincide, 
The essence of a day is non-existent, 
Lifeless... 

Deyhdrated soils may not recover 
From the drought they might be plagued with, 
Prepare to be... 

...The Stillborn One... 
...The Stillborn One... 

When dawn and sunset coincide, 
The essence of a day is non-existent, 
Lifeless... 

Dehydrated soils may not recover 
From the drought they might be plagued with, 
Prepare to be...
