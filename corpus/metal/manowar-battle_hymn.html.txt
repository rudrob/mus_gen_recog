                    By moonlight, we ride
Ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high
Our whips and armors shine
Hail to thee our infantry
Still brave beyond the grave
All sworn the eternal vow
The time to strike is now

Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!

Gone are the days when freedom shone
Now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way
The sands of time will shade
How proud our soldiers stand
With mace and chain in hand
Sound of charge into glory ride
Over the top of the vanquished pride

Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!
Victory, victory, Oh!

To the battle we ride
We crossed a starlit sky
No space no time
We'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died
We crossed a starlit sky
And still no space or time
We'll catch the wind

Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!

Sound of charge into glory ride
Over the top of the anguished pride
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousand side by side

Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
Kill, kill, Oh!
