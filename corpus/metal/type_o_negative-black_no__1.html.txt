                    I went looking for trouble and boy - I found her

She's in love with herself - she likes the dark
On her milk white neck - the Devil's mark

Now it's All Hallow's Eve - the moon is full
Will she trick or treat - i bet she will
She will - happy Halloween - baby

She's got a date at midnight - with Nosferatu
Oh baby, Lily Munster - ain't got nothing on you

Well when I called her evil - she just laughed
Well cast that spell on me - boo bitch craft

Yeah you wanna go out 'cause it's raining and blowing
You can't go out 'cause your roots are showing
Dye 'em black - dye 'em black

Black black black black No. 1
Black black black black No. 1

Little wolf skin boots - and clove cigarettes
An erotic funeral - for witch she's dressed
Her perfume smells like - burning leaves
Everyday is Halloween.

Yeah you wanna go out 'cause it's raining and blowing
You can't go out 'cause your roots are showing
Dye 'em black - dye 'em black

Black black black black No. 1
She dyes 'em black black black black No. 1

Loving you - loving you - love love loving you was like loving
the dead.
Loving you - loving you love love loving you was like - loving
the dead.

Loving you was like loving the dead - loving you was like loving
the dead - loving you was like loving the dead
Was like loving the dead - was like loving the dead - was like
loving the dead.

Sacre bleu

Loving you - loving you - love love loving you was like loving
The dead - was like fucking the dead
Loving you was like loving the dead - loving you was like loving
The dead - loving you was like loving the dead - was like loving
The dead
Loving you - loving you - loving you - loving you - loving you -
Loving you
Was like loving the dead
Was like loving the dead
Was like loving the dead

Black black black black No. 1
She dyes it black black black black No. 1

Ooh yeah

Black black black black No. 1
black black black black No. 1
