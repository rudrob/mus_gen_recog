                    I have witnessed your death
I've seen it many times
Your tortured screams
Your decrepit little mind

A father's son
With pathetic eyes that bleed
Twins in the end
Begin and let the brothers fall

I will see you buried alive
Screaming for your God
I will watch you die again for Him

God won't judge what I've down
He cries upon my feet
A privilege pain beneath
Buried are you dead
On splintered bones
I walk
Sifting through the blood
Besieged to fear
Await the coming of the God!

I will watch you die again for Him

Blood is raining downward
The stain reflects the sun
Conquered, divide within
Terrorize the mind

I've seen the end, it's yours
Rosary in hand
Your selfish flesh, it melts
Spilling from the sky

I will see you burned alive
Screaming for your God
I will watch you die

This is God's war
God's war
This is God's war
God's war

War of holy principles
I'm seeking God's help in your destruction
Slit the throat of heathen man
And let his blood dilute the water
Bury your dead

Fuck your God, erase His name
A lady weeps insane with sorrow
I'll take his towers from the world
You're fucking raped upon your deathbed

This is God's war
God's war
This is God's war
God's war
The holy war

Be optimistic, happy, and calm
Show no fear or anxiety
Smile at the face of God
And your reward will be eternity

Holy warriors your patience will be justified
Everything is for Him
You must not comfort the animal before you kill it

Strike as champions at the heart of the nonbelievers
Strike above the neck
And at all extremities

For this is a point of no return
For Almighty God, God will give bahishti
To his faithful servants
When you reach ground zero
You will have killed the enemy
The Great Satan!
