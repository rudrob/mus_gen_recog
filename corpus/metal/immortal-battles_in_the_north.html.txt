                    Battles In The North

Come forth demonized.
Under the banner of.
Blashyrkh we ride.
In the battlesky.
We lie estranged.
Kings of the ravenrealm.
We trample bejeweled.
Thrones of the earth.
In an age underdreamed of.
Viewing myriad battles.
Yet our eyes sparkling.
Strident with strength.
To trample bejeweled.
Thrones of the earth.
In an age underdreamed of.
The ones to sit upon.
The elder thrones.
With shadowed faces.
For the coming centuries.

Riding towards the masterfields.
A ride from the north.
To the north.
By our sacred raven.
We are one.
In the deadwhite moonlight.
far above we reign mercilessly.
Kings of the ravenrealm.
Stronger than ice.
Stronger than stone.
A horde of heathenhearts to come.

Battle... Battles in the north.

Those who adhere to principle.
Above battlelust.
Sing your songs with dying breath.
For the kings of the ravenrealm.

For the kings of the ravenrealm.
Battle... Battles in the north.
