                    I gave the serpent its beauty,
I gave the serpent its charm.
I gave the serpent its fatal attraction,
And to all that is holy I gave putrefaction. 

No one be my master,
Nor chains I abide.
Look deep into my eyes,
You'll see the storms are at my side.
To all that is holy,
Oh how I hate thee.
Your god, done nothing,
For someone like me. 

I am a child who were born out of sin,
I am a soul that you'll never win.
I see right through, all of your lies.
You have no kingdom,
where people come to when they die. 

Both heaven and hell inside me,
I have chosen the devil, because I like to be free.
Do what thus wilt that is the law,
Or obey under god, and be one of his whores. 

I am a soul that you never win,
I live my life in total sin.
I see right through all of your lies,
You have no kingdom where people come when they die. 

No one be my master, nor chains I abide.
Look deep in my eyes, and you'll see the storm at my side.
To all that is holy, oh how I hate thee.
Your god he is nothing. 

Attera Totus Sanctus
