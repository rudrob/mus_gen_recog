                    Blizzard Beasts

Wintriness lurk within enlocked realms
Strenth beheld our demonthrone
Supernal journeys from the shine
Beyond the spiritside
Yearning in beastworlds tide
Blackening the lands with blight
Benighted watchers with masterly pride
We rise the demonside

Winters spread by blizzard beasts

Wiat no more centuries we have become
Triumphant of an ice age's blast
Above the winters masters rage
Convoke nebular dimensions
As real as the realms we ride
With non above and non at side

Yearning in beastworlds tide
Blackening the lands with might
Benighted watchers with masterly pride
We hold the demonside
Wintriness lurk within enlocked realms
Strenth beheld our demonthrone
Supernal journeys from the shine
Beyond the spiritside

Winters spread by blizzard beasts

Convoke nebular dimensions
As real as the realms we ride
With non above and non at side
