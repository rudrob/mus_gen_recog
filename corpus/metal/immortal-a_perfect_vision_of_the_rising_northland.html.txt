Winter of the ages so dark so cold that flames turn to the bluest frost.
Mountains of ice rises above an dead an frozen ground.
The ravens returns to the hills.
And the Millennium black bells of eternal frost.
Chaim through the Northern lightning.

Upon the mountainside I stand.
The floods of black runs below.
Hair of a cold goatscalp I kiss.
Eyestaken mountains still breathes.
At one with the poisoned ground.

Midnight darksky open up.
A blast of red lightning rides the night.
With doom winds deaths angels fly.
Across a nearly closed skyline.
And the sun freezes at one with the infernal holocaust frozen clouds.

Centuries of doom reigned by the Goathrone of desire.
Raised by sorcery to the Holocaust sky.

North black hordes storms.
Through invisible cyclones of frostwinds.
I lift my hands.
And join the ceremonial circle of one wind.
Eyes of stone now sleeps into eternal night.
This winter is forever.
A wind of red I rode.
A wind of evil cold.

For the years that have passed in the North.
Brought me visions of the Goathrone of desire.

On the hillside where I stood left for another world.
Tragedies blows at horizon.
The sun freezes to dust.

A perfect vision of the rising Northland.
