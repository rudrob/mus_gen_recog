                    I surrender my soul 
Odin hear my call 
One day I'll sit beside your throne 
In Valhalla's great hall 
Like so many before me 
I'll die with honour and pride 
The right of a warrior 
Forever to fight by your side 

Send a sign raise the sail 
way for last goodbye 
Destiny is calling 
Immortality be mine 

Call the witch to cast the runes 
With a magic spell 
We who die in battle are born 
Not for heaven not for hell 

WE ARE SONS OF ODIN 
The fire we burn inside 
Is the legacy of warrior-kings 
Who reign above in a sky 

I will lead a charge 
My sword into the wind 
SONS OF ODIN fight 
To die and live again 
Viking ships cross the sea 
In cold wind and rain 
Sailing to the black of night 
Magic stars are guiding light 

Today the blood of battle 
Upon my weapons will never dry 
Many I send into the ground 
Laughing as they die(ha-ha-ha) 

WE ARE SONS OF ODIN 
The fire we burn inside 
Is the legacy of warrior-kings 
Who reign above in a sky 

I will lead a charge 
My sword into the wind 
SONS OF ODIN fight 
To die and live again 
Viking ships cross the sea 
In cold wind and rain 
Sailing to the black of night 
Magic stars are guiding light 

Place my body on a ship 
And burn it in the sea 
Let my spirit raise 
Valkyries carry me 
Take me to Valhalla 
Where my brothers wait for me 
Fire burning to the sky 
My spirit will never die 

I will lead a charge 
My sword into the wind 
SONS OF ODIN fight 
To die and live again 
Viking ships cross the sea 
In cold wind and rain 
Sailing to the black of night 
Magic stars are guiding light 

I will lead a charge 
My sword into the wind 
SONS OF ODIN fight 
To die and live again 
Viking ships cross the sea 
In cold wind and rain 
Sailing......
