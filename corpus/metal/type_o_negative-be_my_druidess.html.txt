                    Be my druidess
Be my everything
Be my druidess
Be mine.

Around the Pyre, a circle of thirteen,
Throughout these woods, ecstatic screams.

I look deeply into your eyes,
I smell your hair, caress your thighs.

Now we'll make love by fire light,
A blaze so high it lights the night.

Long fingernails dug in my skin,
Yourself so wet invites me in.

Be my druidess
Be my everything
Be my druidess
Be mine.

Our lust increased feeds desire,
As we combust, yeah we on fire.

I feel you shake so deep inside,
Oh scream my name and hold me tight.

I'll do anything to make you cum
I'll do anything to make you...

Be my druidess
Be my everything
Be my druidess
Be mine.

I'll do anything
To make you cum,
I'll do anything
To make you...

I'll do anything
To make you cum,
I'll do anything
To make you cum.

I'll do anything
To make you cum,
I'll do anything
To make you...

I'll do anything
I'll do anything,
I'll do anything
To make you...

                    Â
