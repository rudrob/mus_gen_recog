                    Baptism by fire
Feel the wrath of Satan's relenless flames
Ungodly desires
When god is lost and on his planet hellfire reigns

War master makes his call
As death descending out of clear blue sky
A hailstorm of bombs fall
In the blazing pandemonium your holy powers will die
Death from above - The hellfire will soon be unleashed
Death rips the sky - Domination gives praise to the beast

Baptism by fire

Fatal omens in the sky
Our soldiers burn away your holy lies
Retaliation of the fallen from up high
In the firestorm you choke on your feeble cries

Baptism by fire
A divine punishment for those who go to war
Against those who defied the line
And scaled the christian fate forevermore

Death from above - Explosions is tearing your soul
Death rips the sky - The bombing is reaching its goal

Baptism by fire

Hear the bombs falling
The devil is calling
The godly creation
In obliteration
On your final hour
Experience the power
Of retaliation
Death and domination

I dominate
Your destined fate
All life will soon be gone
Still the flames linger on
See death's shadow in my eyes
High priest of his sacrifice
Through the inferno that burns in the night
Baptism by fire show you our might

Death from above - Death or glory there is no way back
Death rips the sky - Attack, attack, attack!

Baptism by fire
