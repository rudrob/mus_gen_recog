                    Well i loved my aunt - but she died
and my uncle lou - then he died

I'm searching for something which can't be found - but i'm hoping
i still dream of dad - though he died

Everything dies - everything dies

My ma's so sick - she might die
though my girl's quite fit - she will die

Still looking for someone who was around - barely coping
now i hate myself - wish i'd die

Everything dies - everything dies
everything dies - everything

No why - oh God i miss you
no why - oh God i miss you - i really miss you
no no no no

No why - oh God i miss you
no why - oh God i miss you - i really miss you

Everything dies - everything dies
everything dies - everything - no no no no

Everything dies - everything dies
everything dies - everything
