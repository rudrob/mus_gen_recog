                    The core principle of freedom
Is the only notion to obey
The formula of evolution and sin
Leading the way

The rebirth is near completion
As we slowly awaken from slumber
As we slowly awaken from slumber

The malpractice of the spirit ends
Gateways!
When the gift is once again attained
Gateways!
No rules or restraints are longer valid
Gateways!
When the ancient future is reclaimed
Gateways!

No rules or restraints are longer valid
Gateways!
When the ancient future is reclaimed
Gateways!

It's all there for the eye that can see
The blind ones will always suffer in secrecy
For it is the omen
Of what lies submerged
Untouched within us

The core principle of freedom
Is the only notion to obey
The formulae of evolution and sin
Leading the way

The rebirth is near completion
As we slowly awaken from slumber
To receive the light that shines in darkness
The light that shines forevermore
Forevermore!

Be the broken or the breaker
Be the giver or the undertaker
Unlatch and open the doors
Be the healer or the faker
The keys are in your hands
Realize you are your own sole creator
Of your own masterplan

Be the broken or the breaker
Be the giver or the undertaker
Unlatch and open the doors
Be the healer or the faker
The keys are in your hands
Realize you are your own sole creator
Of your own masterplan!
