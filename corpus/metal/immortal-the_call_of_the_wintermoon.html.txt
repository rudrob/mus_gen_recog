                    The Call Of The Wintermoon

Buried beneath the mountains of frost.
Years of silent sorrow grim and dark.
My winterwings of evil sleeps in eternal nights.
In deaths cold crypts of snow.
The moon chaimed my return.
With the blackstorms I came.
And not with the wings.

The Northern darkness marches through the coldest night.

I can't resist the taste from the winds of the moon.
I split my tongue for the taste of these winds.
And bath my eyes in it's grace.
Frost and winters return to my eyes.
The call of the wintermoon.

Nocturnal clouds blows freely in the distance.
In the gray mist of deaths horizon.
My winterwings of evil sleeps.
In deaths cold crypts of snow.
Buried beneath the mountains of frost.
Years of silent sorrow grim and dark.

Into eternal nights.
Hearing the call of the wintermoon.
