                    What is this that stands before me? 
Figure in black which points at me, 
Turn 'round quick and start to run, 
Find out I'm the chosen one 
Oh, No! 

Big black shape with eyes of fire, 
Telling people their desire 
Satan sitting there he's smiling, 
Watches those flames get higher and higher 
Oh, No, No please God help me! 

Is it the end, my friend? 
Satan's come around the bend, 
People running 'cos they're scared 
Ya people better go and beware 
No! No! Please! No!
