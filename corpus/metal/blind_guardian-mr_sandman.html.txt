                    Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Make it the cutest that I've ever seen
Give her two lips like roses in clover
Then tell her that my lonesome nights are over

Mister Sandman, I'm so alone
Don't have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic beam
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream

Mister Sandman, bring me a dream
Make it the cutest that I've ever seen
Give her the word that I'm not a rover
Then tell her that my lonesome nights are over

Mister Sandman, I'm so alone
Don't have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic beam
Mister Sandman, bring me a dream

Mister Sandman, bring us a dream
Give her a pair of eyes with a congeal of gleam
Give her a lonely heart like Harlehatschi
And not so wavy hair like Liberatschi

Mister Sandman, someone to hold
Would be so peachy before we're to old
So please turn on your magic bean
Mister Sandman, brings us
Please, please, please
Mister Sandman, bring us a dream
Yeah...
