                    Here we go again, motherfucker

Come on down, and see the idiot right here
Too fucked to beg and not afraid to care
What's the matter with calamity anyway ?
Right? Get the fuck outta my face
Understand that I can't  feel anything
It isn't like I wanna sift through the decay
I feel like a wound, like I got a fuckin'
Gun against my head, you live when I'm dead

One more time, motherfucker

Everybody hates me now, so fuck it
Blood's on my face and my hands and I
Don't know why, I'm not afraid to cry
But that's none of your business
Whose life is it?  Get it? See it? Feel it? Eat it?
Spin it around so I can spit in its face
I wanna leave without trace
Cuz I don't wanna die in this place

People=(equal)Shit
People=(equal)Shit ( Whatcha gonna do?)
People-(equal)Shit (Cuz I'm not afraid of you)
People=(equal)Shit (I'm everything you'll never be)
People=(equal)Shit

It never stops - you can't be everything to everyone
Contagion -  I'm sitting at the side of Satan
What do you want from me?
They never told me the failure I was meant to be
Overdo it - don't tell me you blew it
Stop your bitchin and fight your way through it
I'M - NOT - LIKE - YOU -  I - JUST - FUCK - UP

C'mon motherfucker, everybody has to die

People=(equal)Shit
People=(equal)Shit ( Whatcha gonna do?)
People-(equal)Shit (Cuz I'm not afraid of you)
People=(equal)Shit (I'm everything you'll never be)
People=(equal)Shit
