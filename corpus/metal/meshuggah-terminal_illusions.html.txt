                    I don't need religion 
god bless no one 
me and my own opinions 
are written by me 
you surrender 
under mass hypnosis 
bound to illusions 
produced by your god 

Who is humane 
real alive no god 

I see your blindness 
erase your identity 
your mind is hollow 
carved to inability 
i know to be 
loyal to myself 
my integrity leaves myself 
alone in peace with me 

God 

There's no god 
life is a trap 
unlock your mind 
trust in yourself 

Wake from the grip of the tongue 
you've been choked oppressed 
god owns god cheats god lies 
god hates god kills god slays 

the pressure on humanity 
has risen beyond control 
we are leading evolution 
into termination 
the sense of hate 
inbreeding scars to innocence 
genetic prejudice a 
self-destructive line in pain 

Why this reality 
life poured into inanity

                    Â
