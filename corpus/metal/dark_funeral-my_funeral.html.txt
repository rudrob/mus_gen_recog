                    "At the end of this long and lonely path,
All misery will be gone"

Down this long and twining road
I walk with heavy feet
My head sunk down low
I have made up my mind
It's time to end this life
Then peace I will find

Walking down to my funeral
The mortal sin...
Some might be sad
I'll die with a grin
Walking down to my funeral
It's time to die
When I leave this pathetic world
I will hold my head high

Angels are watching from above
As so does the evil ones
That lurks down below...

I am almost there - at my funeral

I reach the end of the twining road
I put a bullet in my gun, don't need to reload
Feel the cold steel to my head
It's time to pull the trigger
Soon I'll be dead

Now when I'm at my funeral
I feel so free
Some might be sad
I'll die with grin
Now when I'm at my funeral
I feel so free
The mortal sin...
Sin...

Angels and demons
Reach out for me
Kingdom's wide open
But I walk away from - thee

As I walk away...

"For eternal in twilight I dwell"

Walking down to my funeral,
The mortal sin...
Some might be sad
I'll die with a grin
Walking down to my funeral
It's time to die
When I leave this pathetic world
I will hold my head high

Hold my head high...
