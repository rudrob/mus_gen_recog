                    This magic winter night I see a light
Again I hear that tune, some sort of croon
Oh no, no, no, oh, my brain.
I see them gypsy waggons left in the snow
Oh, I must see that lady, I have to know
Gypsy woman, let me inside
They say you know the secret, secret of time
So gaze into your crystal and tell me
All you see
Gypsy woman, let me know
"Oh, my son, you were never gone
You're the Devil's child and so am I"

Gypsy now I know you're not my mother
You're a part of my soul,
It's dear for all to see
Oh no, no, no, I am you
Gypsy you're inside of me

                    Â
