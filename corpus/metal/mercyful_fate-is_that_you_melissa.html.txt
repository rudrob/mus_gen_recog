                    Oh...melissa, you're in my dreams
You're with me every day

Oh...melissa, could that really be
Your voice I hear?
Too soon for you and i
The priest took his sacrifice
And sent you to the other side

Oh...melissa, you're in my dreams
You're with me every day

Oh...melissa, do you remember
The time we shared?
Do you remember the magic nights?
I will never forget your smile
Do you remember the love we
Had? ...
Oh the love we had

'no...melissa'
You gotta tell me why
'no...melissa'
I want her by my side

'this is against the rules
There won't be another time'
Melissa tell me why
I wanna know why

'no...melissa'
You gotta tell me why
'no...melissa'
I want her by my side

Oh...melissa, you're in my dreams
You're with me every day

Oh...melissa, close your eyes
And say goodbye
One last time...we'll kiss goodbye

I kiss your soul goodbye

                    Â
