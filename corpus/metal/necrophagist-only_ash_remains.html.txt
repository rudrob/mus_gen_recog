                    Fear is never gone from your soul 
that saw humiliation. 
Being prey to the blackest of demons, 
paralyzed you fail. 

Fallen beneath 
the mark of dignity, 
you fail. 

(A) demon passed on from one 
to the next infiltrates 
a mind innocent and pure; 
planting the seed to possess 
another soul that is doomed to fail. 

Only Ash Remains
