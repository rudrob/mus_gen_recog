                    On a long and lonesome highway east of Omaha
 You can listen to the engines moanin' out it's one old song
 You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before
 But your thoughts will soon be wanderin' the way they always do
 When you're ridin' sixteen hours there's nothin' much to do
 And you don't feel much like ridin', you just wish the trip was through

 Here I am
 On the road again
 There I am
 Up on the stage
 There I go
 Playin' the star again
 There I go
 Turn the page

 So you walk into this restaurant, all strung out from the road
 And you feel the eyes upon you as you're shakin' off the cold
 You pretend it doesn't bother you but you just want to explode
 Yeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk, other times you can
 All the same old cliché's, "Is it woman?  Is it man?"
 And you always seem outnumbered, you don't dare make your stand
 Make your stand

 Here I am
 On the road again
 There I am
 Up on the stage
 Here I go
 Playin' the star again
 There I go
 Turn the page
 Whoa, oh

 Out there in the spotlight you're a million miles away
 Every ounce of energy you try to give away
 As the sweat pours out your body like the music that you play, yeah
 Later in the evenin' as you lie awake in bed
 With the echoes of the amplifiers ringin' in your head
 You smoke the day's last cigarette, rememberin' what she said
 (What she said)

 Yeah

 Yeah, and here I am
 On the road again
 There I am
 Up on that stage
 And here I go
 Playin' the star again
 And there I go
 Turn the page
 And there I go
 Turn that page
 There I go, oh yeah yeah
 There I go, yeah yeah
 There I go, yeah
 Here I go, yeah
 There I go, whoa-whoa
 There I go

 (And I'm gone)
