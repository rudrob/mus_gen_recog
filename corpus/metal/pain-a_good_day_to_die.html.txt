                    I don't wanna touch what I can't feel
I don't wanna look when I can't see
Things are flying through my head
All the fucking lies that I can't stand
Someone wake me up from this nightmare
Before I'm gonna wake up dead
Every little thing that I can't control
Like a missile, seek and destroy
Cracking, breaking, I won't take it
Triggers my insanity
Trying to find the answers in my life
My mind is empty, my eyes are blind
I don't need your sympathy, don't want you to stare at me
Drowning in my hollowness
Scratch the surface, you will find, dead man searching suicide
It's a good day to die
Aiming for the things that I can't have
Aiming high and no-one cares
Turning up and tuning in
My own battle I can't win
When will I be next in line
To trigger my soul so I can stay alive
Don't need your sympathy, don't want you to stare at me
Drowning in my hollowness
Scratch the surface, you will find, dead man searching suicide
It's a good day to die
I don't want your gratitude, I was never good for you
Shape of the emptiness
Scratch the surface, you will find, dead man searching suicide
It burns inside, don't be afraid
Don't need your sympathy, don't want you to stare at me
Drowning in my hollowness
Scratch the surface, you will find, dead man searching suicide
It's a good day to die
I don't want your gratitude, I was never good for you
Shape of the emptiness
Scratch the surface, you will find, dead man searching suicide
