                    Auschwitz, the meaning of pain 
The way that I want you to die 
Slow death, immense decay 
Showers that cleanse you of your life

Forced in 
Like cattle you run 
Stripped of 
Your life's worth 
Human mice, for the Angel of Death 
Four hundred thousand more to die 

Angel of Death 
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead 

Sadistic, surgeon of demise 
Sadist of the noblest blood 
Destroying, without mercy 
To benefit the Aryan race 

Surgery, with no anesthesia 
Feel the knife pierce you intensely 
Inferior, no use to mankind 
Strapped down screaming out to die 

Angel of Death 
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead 
Infamous butcher, 
Angel of Death 

Pumped with fluid, inside your brain 
Pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes 
Burning flesh, drips away 
Test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil 
Frigid cold, cracks your limbs 
How long can you last in this frozen water burial? 
Sewn together, joining heads 
Just a matter of time 'til you rip yourselves apart 
Millions laid out 
In their crowded tombs 
Sickening ways to achieve 
The holocaust 

Seas of blood, bury life 
Smell your death as it burns deep inside of you 
Abacinate, eyes that bleed 
Praying for the end of your wide awake nightmare 
Wings of pain, reach out for you 
His face of death staring down, your blood running cold 
Injecting cells, dying eyes 
Feeding on the screams of the mutants he's creating 
Pathetic harmless victims 
Left to die 
Rancid Angel of Death 
Flying free
