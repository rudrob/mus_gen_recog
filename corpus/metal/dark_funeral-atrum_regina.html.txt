                    My nocturnal queen,
Infernal, earthly and divine.
There on your knees,
My beloved concubine.
You look deep into my eyes,
As your mouth opens wide.
Lips moves up and down,
Soon in demon seed you'll drown.

Now close your eyes my love,
Drink my essence, and forever you'll be mine.

Atrum Regina, my nocturnal queen.
Atrum Regina, you fulfil me.

Now rise in front of me,
Oh how I wish to enter thee,
Of lust overwhelmed.
Is this a dream, or is this real.

Now bend down,
Feel my claws runs up your back.
As I enter thee, with full force from behind.
Feel how the demon seed, ejaculate inside.
Goddess of my dreams, my beloved concubine.

Atrum Regina, my nocturnal queen.
You fulfil me, Atrum Regina.

                    Â
