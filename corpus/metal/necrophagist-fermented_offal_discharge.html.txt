                    The casket is exhumed, turfs piled beside the grave 
A stagnant mass awaits me, deep in the gloom 
The boxes lids I open, distraught desecrating 
The fumes are penetrating,I am eructating... I vomit... 
I initiate eager exhuming despite bad scents... 
I dig up cold earth, exhumed turfs I disperse... 
I initiate eager exhuming despite bad scents... 
the open casket reveals the rot 
Into weak stomach I slide my hands 
intensifying fumes I like to snort 
colon and small intestine 
sliced and ripped out of the foul body 
Duodenum I minch - all should be treated equal 
rotten stool and urine 
spurt out of fermented organs 
I discharged and raped - putrified giblets 
disembowel 
Decrepit spleen and pancreas I've torn and gutted 
I eviscerate stomach and cysts 
Liver is torn and twisted - turning inside out 
A fermented offal discharge - Disembowel... 
Evacuated offal hastily wrapped in bags 
as basic for my culinary... 
putrefied internal fragments 
Fermented offal discharge...

                    Â
