                    Brothers I Am Calling From The Valley Of The Kings
With Nothing To Atone
A Dark March Lies Ahead Together We Will Ride
Like Thunder From The Sky
May Your Sword Stay Wet Like A Young Girl In Her Prime
Hold Your Hammers High
Blood And Death Are Waiting Like A Raven In The Sky
I Was Born To Die
Hear Me While I Live Now As I Look Into Your Eyes
None Shall Hear A Lie
Now Power And Dominion Are Taken By The Will
By Divine Right Hail And Kill

Hail Hail Hail And Kill
Hail And Kill
Hail Hail Hail And Kill
Hail And Kill

My Father Was A Wolf I’m A Kinsman Of The Slain
Sworn To Rise Again
I Will Bring Salvation Punishment And Pain
The Hammer Of Hate Is Our Faith
Power And Dominion Are Taken By The Will
By Divine Right Hail And Kill

Hail Hail Hail And Kill
Hail And Kill
Hail Hail Hail And Kill
Hail And Kill

Rip Their Flesh Burn Their Hearts
Stab Them In The Eyes
Rape Their Women As They Cry
Kill Their Servants Burn Their Homes
Till There’s No Blood Left To Spill
Hail And Kill

Power And Dominion Are Taken By The Will
By Divine Right Hail And Kill

Hail Hail Hail And Kill
Hail And Kill
