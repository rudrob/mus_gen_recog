                    Tear down the walls
Wake up the world
Ignorance is not bliss
So fed up with second best
Our time is here and now

I am the enemy
I am the antidote
Watch me closely
I will stand up, now

We will rise (We will rise)
Rise above
We will rise (We will rise)
Rise

Stereotype fools
Playing the game
Nothing unique
They all look the same
In this sea of mediocrity
I can be anything
Anything I want to be

I am the enemy
I am the antidote
Watch me closely
I will stand up, now

We will rise (We will rise)
Rise above
We will rise (We will rise)
Rise

We will rise

I am the enemy
I am the antidote (I am the antidote)

We will rise (We will rise)
Rise above
We will rise (We will rise)
Rise

We will rise (We will rise)
Rise
Rise above
We will rise (We will rise)
Rise

                    Â
