                    When the darkness eats away 
the day
And the moon bears witness to the graves

In the shadows we are alive
In the shadows, The Light

Can you see the ghosts above our
heads?

We are all in there with the dead

In the shadows we are alive
In the shadows, The Light

(Solo)

In the darkness there is no holding
back
There is no gold in black
Deep in the night
Everything is clear
Clearer than daylight

(Solo)

In the land of mystery we share
You can come along if you dare

In the shadows we are alive
In the shadows, The Light

(Solo)

We are hiding in the shadows on
your wall
We are watching as you kiss your
little doll

When the darkness leaves the night
We cannot see The Light no more
No more
We are always in the shadows by
your door
But when the darkness leaves the night
We cannot see The Light no more
No more

There is no holding back
There is no gold in black

Deep in the night
Everything is clear
Clearer than daylight

(Solo)

                    Â
