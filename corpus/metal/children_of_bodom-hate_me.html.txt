                    I was born in ashes of molten hatred.
Raised by demons in abodes of the dead.
The Reaper's scythe I fall upon to light my path.
Wrecked by mangled wounds of life.
I have become become the resurrection, 
of the Evil one.
'Yknow that I don't fucking care if I live or die!
I need a bishop preaching fire, 
to get away with my sins.
I despise everything I see

Ain't got respect for humanity,
Never lived or wanted immortality,
The Reaper's shadow I fall upon to obscure my path,
Every day I'm being battered up until I bleed,
You motherfuckas just leave me be,
Ya could never give me cure for the pain I feel inside.

I need a bishop preaching fire, 
to get away with my sins.
I despise everything I see
I don't give a fuck
If you hate me

Led by the Reaper I walk in the night,
Show me the way to yer kingdom come.


I believe in Armageddon,
I've been baptized in alcohol.
I'm embodiment of Antichrist,
I'm living for my own demise.

                    Â
