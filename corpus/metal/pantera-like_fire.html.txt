Don't get in her way, a sharp shooter that never miss
She's comin' on like a hurricane, might burn your finger tips
Her eyes could blow your mind with a look right on the spot
And once she starts, she'll tear you apart, boy she makes it hot
She's
LIKE FIRE, she's burning hot, everything she's got
LIKE FIRE, tearing up the night, like dynamite
LIKE FIRE, spreading through the town, you'll never slow her down
LIKE FIRE

She's got everything it takes, to keep you satisfied
She'll get you down, let her hands do the talking, ain't no place to hide
'Cause she's over me and she's under me, she's everywhere I turn
Get on her knees, just a' screamin' to please,
Take a chance on gettin' burned
She's
LIKE FIRE, she's burning hot, everything she's got
LIKE FIRE, tearing up the night, just like dynamite
LIKE FIRE, spreading through my town, you'll never slow her down
LIKE FIRE
