                    I won't believe in love
I love the way it tastes
please don't expect too much
cause I don't  wanna be involved

I had my share of women
even some marriage too
and every time I end up with my pants down
looking like a fool...

I'm such a fool...

ref. The older you are, the wiser you get.
just listen to me
when life gets tough,and you know it will.
Then have a drink on me.

The alcohol never talks back to me.
It never tells me when it's time to go home
ti's  been my friend for over 25 years
and she has never cut me low.

Don't  cut me low

ref.

Too many women, too little time
and not enough of whisky
not enough booze for me

I rather lose my liver than to lose my pride
and when I'm dead and buried.
Then just have a drink on me.

I won't believe in love
so don't expect too much.

ref.x2
Just have a drink.
