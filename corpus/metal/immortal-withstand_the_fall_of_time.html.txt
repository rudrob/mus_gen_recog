                    Withstand The Fall Of Time

Darker and darker skylines of red grew my horizon
on the egdes of my vision a giant grimfaced realm...
Flaming suns crested the horizon shadows born a cloudless day
believers of the rise and set of the moon darkened twilight into night...

Hardening claws of cold tell me we are closer to colder times
through the days of bitterness still the thundra lay untouched
In the final of that day and all centuries after
in eternity and time the same still the thundra lay untouched

Blacker and blacker blinded by shades from centuries behind
shadows of a dark that used to be under heavy winters reign...
The blackening sky never end as we stand the fall of time
yet winds of cold will always blow without tomorrow...

Hardening claws of cold tell me we are closer to colder times
through the days of bitterness still the thundra lay untouched
In the final of that day and all centuries after
in eternity and time the same still the thundra lay untouched
