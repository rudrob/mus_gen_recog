                    Surrounded by darkness and cold 
The mind in pain grabs for hold. 

Diminished, to be diminished. 

The missing link in the chain 
Of thoughts in now forever gone. 

Diminished, to be diminished. 

The beast will be wise, feast: eye for an eye. 

The beast will be wise, feast: eye for an eye. 

Surrounded by darkness and cold 
The mind is now forever gone. 

Diminished, to be diminished.
