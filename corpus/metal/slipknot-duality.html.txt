                    I push my fingers into my eyes 
It's the only thing 
That slowly stops the ache 
But it's made of all 
The things I have to take 
Jesus it never ends 
It works it's way inside 
If the pain goes on... 

I have screamed until my veins collapsed 
I've waited as my time elapsed 
Now all I do is live with so much fate 
I've wished for this 
I've bitched at that 
I've left behind this little fact 
You cannot kill what you did not create 

I've gotta say what I've gotta say 
And then I swear I'll go away 
But I cannot promise you'll enjoy the noise 
I guess I'll save the best for last 
My future seems like one big past 
You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice 

I push my fingers into my eyes 
It's the only thing 
That slowly stops the ache 
If the pain goes on 
I'm not gonna make it! 

Pull me back together 
Or separate the skin from bone 
Leave me all the pieces 
Then you can leave me alone 
Tell me the reality is better than the dream 
But I've found out the hard way 
Nothing is what it seems 

I push my fingers into my eyes 
It's the only thing 
That slowly stops the ache 
But it's made of all 
The things I have to take 
Jesus it never ends 
It works its way inside 
If the pain goes on 
I'm not gonna make it! 

All I've got 
All I've got is insane 
All I've got 
All I've got is insane 
All I've got! 
All I've got is insane! 
All I've got! 
All I've got is insane! 

I push my fingers into my eyes 
It's the only thing 
That slowly stops the ache 
But it's made of all 
The things I have to take 
Jesus it never ends 
It works its way inside 
If the pain goes on 
I'm not gonna make it!
