                    In the beginning there was silence and darkness 
All across the earth 
Then came the wind and a hole in the sky 
Thunder and lightning came crashing down 
Hit the earth and split the ground 
Fire burned high in the sky 

From down below fire melted the stone 
The ground shook and started to pound 

The gods made Heavy metal and they saw that it was good 
They said to play it louder than hell 
We promised that we would 
When losers say it´s over with you know that it´s a lie 
The gods made heavy metal and it´s never gonna die 

We are the true believers 
It´s our turn to show the world 
In the fire of heavy metal we were burned 
It´s more than our religion it´s the only way to live 
But the enemies of metal we can´t forgive 

Cause we believe in the power and the might 
And the gods who made metal are with us tonight 

The gods made Heavy metal and they saw that it was good 
They said to play it louder than hell 
We promised that we would 
When losers say it´s over with you know that it´s a lie 
The gods made heavy metal and it´s never gonna die 

We believe in the power and the might 
And the gods who made metal are with us tonight 

We´re here tonight for heavy metal are you ready in the hall 
They have chosen us and we have heard the call 
Gonna tear the roof off with our sound 

Crack the walls and shake the ground 
Fight tonight for metal one and all 

Cause we believe in the power and the might 
And the gods who made metal are with us tonight 

The gods made Heavy metal and they saw that it was good 
They said to play it louder than hell 
We promised that we would 
When losers say it´s over with you know that it´s a lie 
The gods made heavy metal and it´s never gonna die
