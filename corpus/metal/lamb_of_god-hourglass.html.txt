                    Privileged, a chosen few
Blessed with our time in hell
Witness a divine vision, the day we all fell still.
Rapture of the dying age, a shattered hourglass
Wrath of the warring gods and soon this too shall pass.

It's only getting worse, not worth a moment's regret
Each dawn another curse, every breath a twisting blade
What will be left behind in the ashes of the wake?
An ill wind blows this way, the edge of the envelope burns
Forbearance and my vengance, payment for your intent
Fear death in the wings, in thrall of those fallen from grace
Petty is as petty does, witness the mass disgrace.

(Fear and death in the wings, in thrall of those fallen from grace
Petty is as petty does, witness the mass disgrace.)
God forbid you read the signs.
Watch for meaning between the lines
Gehenna has now arrived, no hindsight for the blind.
Your trust has been misplaced, believed the lies told to your face
Became another casualty and now it's too late.

You finally made it home,
Draped in the flag that you fell for.
And so it goes
The ashes of the wake.
It's only getting worse...(x5)
