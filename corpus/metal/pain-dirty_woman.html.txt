                    I just fell out the sky it’s been a hell of a ride,
I’m back again
Things were looking good, I was on the move
Until I met you

So we lose in the sky got a smile of an Angel
Come here and spread your wings
I’m just a dirty old man trying to play your game
I’ll set your wings on fire

She locks me down
I’m in for the count
I’m going down

Oh dirty woman, she tricks you with her smile
My dirty woman, she’s in for the kill, killing me

Her needs
her life,
not afraid to show what’s on her mind

I never listen to a word of what people say
just stay away from you
Cause I don’t need a woman to slow me down,
Don’t want to sing the blues

No!

She locks me down!
I’m in for the count
I’m going down, down down.

Oh dirty woman, she tricks you with her smile
My dirty woman, she’s in for the kill, killing me

Oh dirty woman, she tricks you with her smile
My dirty woman, she’s in for the kill, killing me

Oh!

Oh dirty woman, she tricks you in her smile
My dirty woman she’s in for the kill, killing me

Oh dirty woman, she tricks you in her smile
My dirty woman she’s in for the kill, killing me

Oh dirty woman.
