                    I can't run away from the thing in me 
i'm weakening down another now developing 
within 

I can feel it it's inside my head 
connected to my brain this other me is 
slowly taking over deep beneath the 
eye that 
all can see energetic visions of the one 
i know myself to be 

Look into my eyes don't listen to 
their lies 

How can i stop this from being real 
no my life will be no longer what it always 
used to be 

Life neglected infected by strain 
i fall into the smothering the even 
flow of 
ravaging pain this my temple of self-caged 
contempt a body slowly pierced by 
inevitable me 

Do i differ from yourself am i like 
they say 
the truth eventually i'm the one you 
wanna be 
can you feel the same as i another inside 
pushing to free itself from the chains 
of the soul 

Turn your eyes toward the inside 
dig deep within i'm sure you'll find 
a different self a different soul 
to put you in peace with mind

                    Â
