                    Love me forever, or not at all,
End of our tether, backs to the wall,
Give me your hand,
Don't you ever ask why,
Promise me nothing, live 'till we die,

Everything changes,
Live all stays the same,
Everyone guilty, no one to blame,
Every way out,
Brings you back to the start,
Everyone dies
To break somebody's heart,

We are the system, we are the law,
We are corruption, worm in the core,
One of another, laugh 'til you cry,
Faith unto death or knife in your eye.

Everything changes,
Live all stays the same,
Everyone guilty, no one to blame,
Every way out,
Brings you back to the start,
Everyone dies
To break somebody's heart,
Oh, my lost love, come on back to me

Love me or leave me, tell me no lies,
Ask me no questions, send me no spies,
You know love's a thief,
Steal your heart in the night,
Slip through your fingers,
You best hold on tight.

Everything changes,
Live all stays the same,
Everyone guilty, no one to blame,
Every way out,
Brings you back to the start,
Everyone dies
To break somebody's heart,
Oh, my lost love, come on back to me

                    Â
