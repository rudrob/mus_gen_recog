Steve: "Oh yeah?" 

Vic: "Hum! Went down for ten feet, got a JCB from the road here 'cause my other one wouldn't reach. Doug after ten, fifteen minutes went back to the hole to check the height... she's full of water! Must have come from the river, alright? 

Steve: "Alright... someone must have pissed in it." 

Vic: "Say well, she's a fucking big piss... somebody did."

Someone: "Something you were doing down the..." 

Vic: "...Yeah! Coming through the ground, it's like a well. About three feet deep So I....that's right, fucking John shit himself. There was soil, it's like quicksand.... he went down there to spread the fucking soil, and he's sinking in, isn't he. He suddenly reached for the fucking fork lift and I lifted up he couldn't reach it... he was shitting himself. He was just going by the at the end of the boots. He said "I'm fucking going, I'm going! Just lower the fucking forklift quick!" And he grabbed hold of it, so I had to lift it up with him hanging on the end of it. Good job he didn't let go otherwise right in the fucking mud!"

Gonna write a little letter, gonna mail it to my local MP 
He's a Maltese man and he's mowing the lawn my way 
Roll over Vic Vella, give me more bales of hay 

Roll over Vic Vella, Roll over Vic Vella 
Roll over Vic Vella, Roll over Vic Vella 
Roll over Vic Vella, Don't you mow that lawn my way 

Early in the morning i'm giving you a warning 


 Don't you step on my tractor blades
Hey devil he's on the fiddle and he ain't got nothing to lose 
Roll over Vic Vella, tell the tax man the bad news 

Roll over Vic Vella, Roll over Vic Vella 
Roll over Vic Vella, Roll over Vic Vella 
Roll over Vic Vella, Don't you tell the tax man the news 

You want to buy a truck and need a new VCR 
Vic he gonna say he knows where they are 
Roll over Vic Vella, I see that panda-car 

(Solo: Dave Murray) 

Roll over Vic Vella, Roll over Vic Vella 
Roll over Vic Vella, Roll over Vic Vella 
Roll over Vic Vella, Don't you play those games with me 

Roll over Vic Vella, Roll over Vic Vella 
Roll over Vic Vella, Roll over Vic Vella 
Roll over Vic Vella, Don't you play those games with me 

Roll over Vic Vella, Roll over Vic Vella 
Roll over Vic Vella, Roll over Vic Vella 
Roll over Vic Vella, Don't you play that game with me
