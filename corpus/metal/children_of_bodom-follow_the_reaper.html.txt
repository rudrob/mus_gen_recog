                    {Death be not proud 
Though some have called thee mighty and dreadful 
Art not so}

Yeao

Yeao We lost the war, I'm feelin' to win 
Though I never tried to strive deep from within 
Life could be beautiful for anybody it's for 
But I'd swear this motherfuckin' shit is rotten to the core

The portal has been past and it's time to make a turn 
To follow the reaper until the point of no return

Yeao

When your blindly death rayin' blade 
Sweeps the griefs and tears away 
I cross my heart and hope to die 
Thy freedom will be mine

Sinkin' down in the ocean of severe emotions 
Grab a bottle to drink up the pain relievin' potion 
But after all, that got boring too 
So no matter what happens, I couldn't give a damn too

Wow

The portal has been past till the point of no return 
No more lines to cross, no bridges to burn

Now


Now when your blindly death rayin' blade 
Swept my griefs and tears away 
I'd never go back to cross that line 
I cross my heart and hope 
To die

{I was only twenty one when I died}
