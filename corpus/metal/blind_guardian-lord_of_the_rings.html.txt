                    There are signs on the ring
which make me feel so down
there's one to enslave all rings
to find them all in time
and drive them into darkness
forever they'll be bound
Three for the Kings
of the elves high in light
nine to the mortal
which cry

I'll keep the Ring full of sorrow
I'll keep the Ring till I die
I'll keep the Ring full of sorrow
I'll keep the Ring till i die 

Slow down and I sail on the river
Slow down and I walk to the hill

And there's now way out
Mordor
dark land under Sauron's spell
threatened a long time
threatened a long time
Seven rings to the dwarves 
in their halls made of stone
into the valley
I feel down
One ring to  the Dark Lord's hand
sitting on his throne
in the land so dark
where I have to go

I'll keep the Ring [5x] 

Slow down and I sail on the river
Slow down and I walk to the hill
Lord of the rings
