                    If ever words were spoken, 
painful and untrue. 
I said I loved, 
but I lied. 
In my life, 
all i wanted..was the keeping of someone like you. 
As it turns out, 
deeper within me, 
love was twisted and pointed at you. 
- Never ending pain. Quickly ending life - 

(Chorus) 
You keep this Love Thing, Love Child, Love Toy! 
You keep this Love Fist, Love Scar, Love Break! 
You keep this Love! (4x's) 

I'd been the tempting one, 
stole her from herself. 
This gift in pain, 
her pain was life. 
And sometimes, 
I feel so sorry, 
I regret this .. the hurting of you. 
But you make me .. so unhappy, 
I'd take my life and leave love with you. 
- I'd kill myself for you. I'd kill you for myself - 

(Chorus) 

No .. more .. head ..trips!!
