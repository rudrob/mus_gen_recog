                    September sun blowing golden hair
Now keep in mind son she was never there
October's rust bisecting black storm clouds
Only the deaf hear my silent shouts

Yet in the dark still he screams your name
Nights living with death with which rhymes insane
Ten years amassed para toda mi vida?
Lost man in time was his name Peter?

September sun rotted flatbush porch
I would have run then had I known the cost
Autumnal rays turned your eyes to stone
Did it give you pleasure to steal my soul?

Yet in the dark still he screams your name
Nights living with death with which rhymes insane
Ten years amassed para toda mi vida?
Lost man in time was his name Peter?

Leave her alone. (repeated several times)
Me? -I know why.
