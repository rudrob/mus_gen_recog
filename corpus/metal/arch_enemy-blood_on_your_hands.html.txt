                    You were born your brother’s keeper
Why can I see blood on your hands?
How became your brother’s slayer
Embrace again in death

At the end of all this hatred lies even deeper hate
Their darkness has defeated you – Your lifeline running backwards

Remember – Sins Of Our Fathers
A Requiem – For The Countless Dead

Blood is on your hands – The wages of sin

Future’s eyes closing now
Soul eclipse taking place
Laments rise – tears of the dead
From the other side of the grave

You were born your brothers keeper
Why can I see blood on your hands?
Their darkness has defeated you
Your lifeline running backwards
