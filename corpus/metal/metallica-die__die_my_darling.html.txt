                    Die, die, die my darling
 Don't utter a single word
 Die, die, die my darling
 Just shut your pretty EYES

 I'll be seeing you again
 I'll be seeing you in hell

 Don't cry to me oh baby
 Your future's in an oblong box
 Don't cry to me oh baby
 Should have seen it a-coming on
 Don't cry to me oh baby
 I don't know it was in your power
 Don't cry to me oh baby
 Dead-end soul for a dead-end girl
 Don't cry to me oh baby
 Now your life drains on the floor
 Don't cry to me oh baby

 Die, die, die my darling
 Don't utter a single word
 Die, die, die my darling
 Just shut your pretty mouth

 I'll be seeing you again
 I'll be seeing you in Hell

 Don't cry to me oh baby
 Your future's in an oblong box
 Don't cry to me oh baby
 Should have seen it a-coming on
 Don't cry to me oh baby
 I don't know it was in your power
 Don't cry to me oh baby
 Dead-end soul for a dead-end girl
 Don't cry to me oh baby
 Now your life drains on the floor
 Don't cry to me oh baby

 Die, die, die my darling
 Don't utter a single word
 Die, die, die my darling
 Just shut your pretty mouth

 I'll be seeing you again
 I'll be seeing you in Hell

Die, die die...
