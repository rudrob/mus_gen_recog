                    Yell with the wind, though the wind won't help you fly at all
Your back's to the wall
Chain the sun, and it tears away and it breaks you as you run
You run, you run!
Behind the smile, there's danger and a promise to be told:
You'll never get old - ha!
Life's fantasy - to be locked away and still to think you're free you're free, we're free!

So live for today
Tomorrow never comes

Die young, die young
Can't you see the writing on the wall?
Die young, gonna die young
Someone stopped the fall

Yell with the wind, though the wind won't help you fly at all
Your back's to the wall
Chain the sun, and it tears away and it breaks you as you run
You run, you run!

So live for today
Tomorrow never comes

Die young, young!
Die young, die young!
Die young, die young, young!
Die young, die young, die young, die young, die young
Die young, die young, die young!
