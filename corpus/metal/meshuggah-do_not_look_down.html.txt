                    Strive, strive, surmount the obstacles
Become the essence of your goals, hereditary dream
Pray that you may attain that destiny
Fall into the coveted line, 
Where life is but a theme of pretense in lustrous guise

Claims and values, charts of means and status
Plaques to show your strife
Do your neighbor clones approve?
Picture perfect illustration, imitation of life
Where the path is evened out, all obstructions removed

Great, viable citizen
Are you happy now?
Then praise your god and bow

Shimmering surface
The gleam of blinding lies
Become the product
The thing you so desire

To what length would you go to reach your goals?
What mantra will you use to justify your means?
Who will you betray to secure your dream?
What sins will you commit to avoid your sins to be seen?

Do not look down
Do not look down
Or the abysmal beast of nonconformity might stare some unpleasant truth into your desensitized mind

Shimmering surface
The gleam of blinding lies
Become the product
The thing you so desire

                    Â
