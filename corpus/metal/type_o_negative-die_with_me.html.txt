                    Now like a bird
she flew away,
to chase her dreams
of books and praise.

still I miss her
yeah I miss her
since she's gone.

at JFK
who played the fool?
self-pity sick
jet fuel perfume.

still I miss her
yeah I miss her
since she's gone.

girl I want to die with you,
in each others arms
we'll drown in flame.

if this time were the last time,
could I hold you
hold you
hold you
all life long?

since this time is the last time,
can I hold you
hold you
hold you
all night long?

[x2]
lay your head down for the last time,
the last time,
for the last time,
the last time,

hey KLM
AT&T;
the UK post system
do you still love me?

still I miss her
yeah I miss her
since she's gone.

Girl I
Want to
Die with you,
In each
Others arms
We'll drown in flame.

                    Â
