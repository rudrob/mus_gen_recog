                    The realm's bleeding
It suffers
Old and weak
No further argued
There is war at end
(The system's weak)
Engines running

Then after all I sense the end is starting
These lunatics deny the truth
 I know I will not fail
There'll be

War it's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
(I'm coming home)
War it's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
Coming HOOOHOOOME!

You're chasing twilight and you know
You will be on your own
On your OOOOHOOOOWN!

The misery's shown
I'll be alone in this hour
I'll face the unknown
Witness the end

I'm bleeding
I'm fading
Here in my final hour
When long-lost memories return
And a voice keeps calling
"All dead and gone"

It's out of hand
Life is in motion
(I'm wishing, I'm fading)
Time to wake up
Face the truth

I'm sinking I'm drowning
There's no doubting
No regret
(Time to reveal now)
This is no illusion
It is real
Carry on the flame
It's not over now
Watch me I will rise
(Time to reveal now)

I know I will not fail anymore

Bind the one forever
All that really matters
Blessed realm
This world is sacred
(I'm coming home)
War it's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home

Yesterday's gone
There's no today nor tomorrow
I'd risk all the land
The ritual failed

There at the gates
I'm left alone in this hour
Driven insane
I am left alone

And now I drown in deepest shadows
While the golden hall is sealed
I'm wishing
I'm fading
And I am part of the machine

No one lives forever
All that really matters
Find the one
This world is sacred
(I'm coming home)
War it's now or never
We shall stand together
One by one
This world is sacred
I'm coming home
(HOOOOOOOOOOME!)
