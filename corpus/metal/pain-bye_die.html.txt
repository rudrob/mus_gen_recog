                    Tell me
What do you see when you see yourself
I don't really get it
How do you make it through the day without killing yourself

Bye bye, why don't you go and
Die die, I'll fuck you up
You want me on my knees
But I'm not going down

Bye bye, leave me alone or
Die die, it is your choice
No time for games, so just leave me the fuck alone

Do you know, you're all the same
Got to play these stupid games
You're getting on my nerves, so just stay the fuck away
Who died and made you god
This time you've gone too far
I think it's time for you to understand: this is war

There's nothing to see here, I don't wanna be here
Get me out of here right now
I can not sit around and wait for you to drive me insane

Bye bye, why don't you go and
Die die, I'll fuck you up
You want me on my knees
But I'm not going down

Bye bye, leave me alone or
Die die, it is your choice
No time for games, so just leave me the fuck alone

So you think I'm unreasonable
Do you really think I am a toy that you can kick around
Don't come here, you're a waste of time
Some people never know when it's time to back away
It will come back at you and slap you in the face

I don't have the patience so what are you after
Do you want me to snap right now?
Some things will never ever change, like you and your ugly face

Bye bye, why don't you and
Die die, I'll fuck you up
You want me on my knees but I'm not going down

Bye bye, leave me alone or
Die die, it is your choice
No time for games so just leave me the fuck alone

Bye bye, it's your choice
Die die, I'll fuck you up
Bye bye, why don't you go and
Die die, LEAVE ME ALONE
