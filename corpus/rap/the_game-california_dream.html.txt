                    [Verse 1 - Game]
 I'm at the house bout to roll this kush up
 I can get a call at any minute, so I'm just doing push-ups
 Waiting on what seems to be forever
 I burned a hole in my Polo sweater cause I was nervous
 That's how crazy birth is, loading up this Beretta
 Cause this time I'm having a baby girl
 So it's whatever, whenever.. whatever
 You my willow and it's my will to make this last forever
 First thing I'mma tell her? Daddy's your umbrella
 Get with a glass slipper Cali, you my Cinderella
 Gotta be a dream, hold up, that's your middle name!
 Both your brothers big now, so baby you my little Game
 Who gon be the Godfather? Swizz? Lil Wayne?
 Y'all smoke too much but got Cali tatted on his veins
 And I just got a text from your mama
 Saying the water burst, I guess it's time for my comma..


[Verse 2 - Game]
 You walk through the door, she on the ground crying
 She don't wanna get up, you had a baby right here
 I ain't cleaning that shit up!
 I finally got her out the house, now we on the elevator
 She screaming, her left the car seat
 But I'mma tell her later
 Forget the car seat - man - I'm hella-faded
 She like "I know you ain't high!" Man, I'm celebrating..
 Now we in the car, she won't put on her seatbelt
 Screaming at the top of her lungs: "I need help!"
 Weaving through traffic, minutes between contractions
 Close your eyes right now, and you can see it happening
 Imagine: she pulling on me "stop I'm about to crash, shit!"
 Butterflies in my stomach, heart beating fast as shit
 Every time I have a kid, it's like the first time
 Kids the best, but they be coming at the worst times
 Now we here, Tiff get in the wheelchair
 Butterflies still here - am I happy? Hell yeah!


[Verse 3 - Game]
 I parked the car, now I'm running through the halls lost
 Trying to figure out which one of these rooms is ours
 Think: damn.. one of the nurses stuck her head out
 They gave her an epideral so I pulled the couch bed out
 Took a nap, woke up, they almost got the head out
 She grabbing on the rails, looking like she about to pass out
 Told her to breathe, grab my phone and hit record
 "Breathe! 1, 2, 3, 4 - one more - 1, 2, 3, 4"
 Push! C'mon Tea, push! God damn it, just push!"
 Nurse coaching her, doctor pulling on shoulders
 Giving me the notion to cut the umbilical
 She out, 8 pounds 4 ounces
 Hold up: I'm about to make an announcement
 See, every time a child is born somebody leave the world
 So I thank the woman who gave her life for my baby girl
