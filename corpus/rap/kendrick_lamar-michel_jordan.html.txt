                    [I used to want to be like Michael Jordan. Figure out what hit the NBA. And make me a fortune]

Uhh…Every time I’m in my city I be hacking like my shit….don’t stink.
Used to clean my rolling chain with alcohol in the sink.
Ridin’ ‘round with niggas that I grew up with since Mac-nair.
Bumpin’ me against the world,“Hello world, Kendrick here!”
And I’m too much for these niggas.
I’m three much for these ho’s.
I’m too much for these niggas
I’m three much for these ho’s.
I’m too much for these niggas
I’m three much for these ho’s.
Wayne told me that,
and that’s just how it goes.

Michael Jordan…
Bounce bounce, ho. Bounce Bounce!
This shit make a nigga get some bread or bust a head or fuck my enemy’s bitch, actin’ bad and gettin’ rich.
Pull up on these 26’s
I’m a vanity slave.
I’m a sinner, Jesus Christ.
Please forgive me for my ways.
I don’t know why your bitch want to fuck me.
And I don’t know why you fuck-niggas can’t see.
I’m a Comp-town representer.
Concrete back-flipper.
AKA that nigga…..don’t worrwy.
I don’t know why your bitch want to fuck me.
And I don’t know why you fuck-niggas can’t see.
This is Hiii-power
Since the Eddie Bower,
I’ve been popular.
I’m poppin’ now
every other hour.
Paparazzi come.
You jockin’ the Let-her-be-a-ho.
Why you stoppin’ though?
We stoppin’ the traffic.
What you know about them hockey pucks?
Skatin’ on ‘em.
Why you Hatin’ on ‘em?
You should learn from ‘em.
Seen too many of y’all gettin’ money.
Know my turn comin’.
I don’t know why your bitch want to fuck me.
I don’t know why (hey, wait a minute motherfucker…)

[Chorus]
Everytime I’m in my city I be feelin’ like my shit…don’t stink.
Used to clean my rolling chain with alcohol in the sink.
Ridin’ ‘round with niggas that I grew up with since Mac-nair.
Bumpin’ me against the world,“Hello world, Kendrick here!”
And I’m too much for these niggas.
I’m three much for these ho’s.
I’m too much for these niggas
I’m three much for these ho’s.
I’m too much for these niggas
I’m three much for these ho’s.
Wayne told me that,
and that’s just how it goes.
Michael Jordan, bitch. (4x).
That means I’m too much for these niggas.
I’m three much for these ho’s.
Wayne told me that,
and that’s just how it goes.

Man, the game chose me, what am I to do?
The only thing I did wrong was make it possible.
I diddy-bop and make them titties pop.
Out there on my bumper, like a city-cop.
Walkin’ out the fresh seagull ?? Put my girl on it.
Ass so fat, probably sit the world on it.
Ayy…..
Pussy crazy
Pussy crazy.
YOU FUCK NIGGAS.
Your pussy’s crazy!

Man, I know I can’t tell you about the world, homie.
But I know I can tell you about your girl, homie.
Her pussy’s crazy.
Her pussy crazy.
I FUCK NIGGA.
I know you hate me.
I know they pay me too much of attention.
Bring my name up, it gotta be mentioned.
I need me an engine
that can go real fast.
Call it hall of fame
once it hall ass.
Give me tall glass
Coke is a rock??
Please, no soda pop.
I make my soda pop.
Life’s a bitch.
Her pussy crazy,
but I make that pussy pay me.

[Chorus]
Everytime I’m in my city I be feelin’ like my shit…don’t stink.
Used to clean my rolling chain with alcohol in the sink.
Ridin’ ‘round with niggas that I grew up with since Mac-nair.
Bumpin’ me against the world,“Hello world, Kendrick here!”
And I’m too much for these niggas.
I’m three much for these ho’s.
I’m too much for these niggas
I’m three much for these ho’s.
I’m too much for these niggas
I’m three much for these ho’s.
Wayne told me that,
and that’s just how it goes.
Michael Jordan, bitch. (4x).
That means I’m too much for these niggas.
I’m three much for these ho’s.
Wayne told me that….

[Schoolboy Q]
I remember trippin’ walkin’ through the sack like my glock don’t think.
Grandma in the kitchen, that bone’s in the sink.
I don’t know why you bitch want to fuck me.
And I don’t know why you sucka-niggas can’t see.
I-I-I’m from hoover man.
High as super man.
Shit you Louis Lane.
You pussy man,
with the pussy game.
Shit, we off the chain.
We poppin’ the fortune not the fame.
Shit, you backers, man.
You chasin’ ho’s.
Re-replacing ho’s.
Bag-and-pass them ho’s.
You brought and chose.
Guess she movin’ on.
Yep, we do it wrong.
We fuck the homes.
Fuck the center-homes.
Marijuana strong.
You know I’m gone.
Turn my swagger on.
Am I swagged enough?
My paper long.
Yep, you left alone.
Y-Y-Y-You gets no fucks.
Leanin’ off the act of us.
Passin’ blunts round-and-round.
Told me Mary was a go,
so we passed her round and round.
Your bitch texted me, wants it now,
so I had to knock her down.
Hurt her bouncin’ off my balls.
Slingin dick up from the mouth??
You let it slide, I hit home-runs.
Clean her dugout ‘til I’m done.
I can be your number 2 and you can be her number 1.
Her pussy’s crazy.
Her pussy’s crazy.
YOU FUCK-NIGGAS.

[Chorus, Kendrick Lamar]
Everytime I’m in my city I be feelin’ like my shit…don’t stink.
Used to clean my rolling chain with alcohol in the sink.
Ridin’ ‘round with niggas that I grew up with since Mac-nair.
Bumpin’ me against the world,“Hello world, Kendrick here!”
And I’m too much for these niggas.
I’m three much for these ho’s.
I’m too much for these niggas
I’m three much for these ho’s.
I’m too much for these niggas
I’m three much for these ho’s.
Wayne told me that,
and that’s just how it goes.
Michael Jordan, bitch. (4x).
That means I’m too much for these niggas.
I’m three much for these ho’s.
Wayne told me that,
and that’s just how it goes.
