                    [Intro]
I'm riding up uptown
I'm a mothafuckin' monster
One hand on the wheel, one hand on my dick
I'm a motherfucking monster
You riding up uptown
One hand on the wheel, one hand on my dick

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
At the green light I'm speeding, fourth wheel on, I'm weaving
I got red eyes and swag seizures, all my concerts filling them bleachers
Ooh girl with this camo on, they can't see us
Tossed in a little more dank and a little more drank
Then La Flame might need..to the point
Where they can't be topped, fuck around, make the Latinas pop
It's a new world order, never had my head on my shoulders
Beware of the monsters, ain't that what your preacher told ya?
La Flame 500 degrees from the uptown to the magnolia

[Hook]
I'm a mothafuckin' monster
I'm a mothafuckin' monster
I'm riding up uptown
I'm a mothafuckin' monster
One hand on the wheel

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Damn you gorgeous, tell me something I don't know
Dice on the corner with the lights low, got the base in my sock, fuck the 5-0
Damn you conscious, gon' get your head off the plate though
Let me show you Yamamoto, take a little lick of the mayo
Out on 135th, spending them pesos
Tell my nigga Fergie Ferg keep the back locked
Cause we got a little bit of Tango
Real nigga from the South to the East they feel a nigga
Been a while since a nigga get a wait
Take a little taste, leave you numb feeling in the face
I'll pass if that pint ain't sealed, I'll make your weak inhale
XX know that we gon' die for this and probably keep it trill
Chain links, by nigga, popular demand nigga
My bitch pearls from the clams, nigga, she can ride the dick no hands

[Hook]
While I'm riding uptown
I'm a mothafuckin' monster

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
Young Fergestein – Little Frankenstein
Pockets full of Benji Franklins, teacher, stay in line
Cannot take a break, in time, I'll take ya shine
Take your bitch, hit it from the back, I'll break her spine
I'm a lady, your bitch look like Shanaynay
Margiela so cold feel like Tommy get to his payday
Going nuts like a Payday, bitches thinking I'm crazy
My fraternity is the burna heat, I’m a Kappa nigga with an AKA
Barking loud like Q-Dogs, moving niggas like U-Hauls
Pussy niggas so RuPaul, you pussies get me tight like blue balls

[Outro]
I'm riding up uptown
I'm a mothafuckin' monster
I'm riding up uptown
