Verse 1: Dmx

If I gots-to bring it to you cowardz then it's gonna be quick,
All your mens up in the jail before, suck my dick.
and all them other cats you run with, get done with, done quick,
how tha fuck you gonna cross the dog with some bum shit?,
There go the gun click, 911 shit,
all over some dumb shit,
ain't that some shit,
Ay niggaz remind me of a strip club,
cause everytime you come around it's like what I just gotta get my dick sucked,
And I don't know who the fuck you think you talking to,
but I'm not him, aight slim?
So watch what you do.
Or you gon find yourself,
buried next to someone else,
and we all thought you loved yourself.
But that couldn't of been the issue,
or maybe they just say'n that now cause they miss you,
shit a nigga tried to dis you.
That's why you lay'n on your back look'n at the roof of the church,
preacher tell'n the truth and it hurts.

Verse 2: Dmx

Off the chain
I leave niggaz soft in the brain,
cause niggaz still want the fame,
off the name.
First of all, you ain't rapped long enough,
to be fuck'n with me, and you,
you ain't strong enough.
So whateva it is you puff'n on that got you think that you superman.
I got the Kryptonite, should I smack you with my dick or the mic?
Y'all niggaz is characters,
not even good actors,
What's gone be the outcome,
Umm, let's add up all tha factors....
You wack,
you're twisted,
your girl's a whore,
you're broke,
your kid ain't yours,
and everybody know.
Your old man say you stupid,
you be like, "So,
I love my baby mother,
I never let her go"
I'm tired of weak ass niggaz whin'n over pu,
that don't belong to them,
fuck is wrong with them,
They fuck it up for real niggaz like my mans and them,
who get it on the strength of the hands with them, man....

Hook: 2X

Verse 3: DMX

I bring down rains so heavy it curse the head,
no more talk'n, put him in the dirt instead,
you keep walk'n, unless you try'n to end up red,
cause if I end up unfed, ya'll end up dead.
Cause youse a soft type nigga,
fake up North type nigga,
puss like a soft white nigga.
Dog is a dog, blood's thicker than water,
we done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter,
the bigger the order, the more guns we brought out
We run up in there, everybody come out,
aight nobody run out
sun in to sun out, I'ma keep the gun out
nigga runnin his mouth? I'ma blow his lung out.
Listen,
yo ass is about to be miss'n,
you know who gone find you,
some old man fishin,
Grandma wishin, your soul's at rest,
but it's hard to digest with the size of the hole in your chest,
