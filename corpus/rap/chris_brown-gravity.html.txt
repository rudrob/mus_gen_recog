                    Stuck in the middle of my past and my future
Stuck in between us, tryina give love another try
But it's ripping me up, 'cause I'd rather go on and be lonely
Give me that give up, so I'll be gone with the wind
Girl, you gotta let me go
You never held me when I fall down, oh, face down

I'm Far away, you bring me down like gravity
I just gotta run away, I need space
It's time for me to break away from you
It's time for me to get away
It's time for me to get away, 
It's hard for me to run away, 
It's hard for me to get away.

Feeling lost, back and fourth
Jumping on this bumpy road
Can you please listen to me?
I don't need the games, girl, I want out
Middle of the street, on my knees
With the traffic on the highway I used to believe
You were good for me
My life's turning upside down!

Girl, you gotta let me go
You never held me when I fall down, oh, face down

I'm Far away, you bring me down like gravity
I just gotta run away, I need space
It's time for me to break away from you
It's time for me to get away
It's hard for me to get away,
It's hard for me to run away, 
It's hard for me to get away.

Now I'm falling faster
Your love's my disaster
Let me live,
I can't take this anymore
Now I'm falling with
Your love's my disaster
Let me live, oh oh oh

I'm Far away, you bring me down like gravity
I just gotta run away, I need space
It's time for me to break away from you
It's time for me to get away
It's hard for me to get away, 
It's hard for me to run away, 
It's hard for me to get away.

I know it's hard for me to get away from you.
It's hard for me to get away.
It's hard for me to run away.
It's hard for me to get away.
