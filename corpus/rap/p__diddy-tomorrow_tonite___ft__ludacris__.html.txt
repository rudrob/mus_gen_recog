                    Let’s not think about tomorrow, tonight!
Let’s take a little time all five,
Maybe …
Your work, your bills, I’ma get them all off your mind!
Let me get them, and hit them, I’m with the rhythm,
Put them right where you want them,
Man, I’ma blow your brain!
Diddy got the remedy for the enemies,
And the run is the gun, so my flow go back!
I’m on the last train to Paris,
...bonjour!
…
See, we all just came to party,
Don’t you wait for the past, just…
And when we start going in this club
You go start coming out the club.

My club is…full!
I’m slipping on some rocking Red Bulls,
Come on!
I’m feeling amplified,
Somebody’s girl is gonna get f-cked tonight!
Tonight!
See I just grab her arm,
Hey pretty girl, don’t need to be alone, no!
Cause I just wanna make you feel good, baby
Than you ever did, no mean no harm!
No!

[Bridge:]
Hey baby girl, you’re a shining star,
So let’s take a movie and play your part!
You’re looking ready, just be yourself!
So come home with me, let’s lose control!

[Chorus:]
Oh, let’s not think about tomorrow, tonight!
Let’s just live the moment!
Oh, let’s not think about tomorrow, tonight!

Now we’re at my condo,
All the way up on the top floor.
It’s time to take a toast,
I see you come in…
Come on…!
Girl you’re smoking?
You got me high, tell me, is your role in?
I can get you whatever you need,
Tell me what is gonna take to keep this party going!
Don’t stop!

[Bridge:]
Hey baby girl, you’re a shining star,
So let’s take a movie and play your part!
You’re looking ready, just be yourself!
So come home with me, let’s lose control!

[Chorus:]
Oh, let’s not think about tomorrow, tonight!
Let’s just live the moment!
Oh, let’s not think about tomorrow, tonight!
Let’s just live the moment!
Oh, let’s not think about tomorrow, tonight!
Let’s just live the moment!
Oh, let’s not think about tomorrow, tonight!

Hold up,…roll it up in the papers,
And the put the switches in the air!
Put your drinks up, and we go…all around,
In the sky like we just don’t care.
Get the speakers loud,
As we can get them with the base and …to put the track on…
Call me… these women, ready for lifts up, so put my voice on blast!
Mad! We…
Pull upon a female and a…
Got ass? Come back to me,
Cause you’re looking like butter melted biscuit.
…just pose,
And when we start going in this club
You go start coming out the club.

[Chorus:]
Oh, let’s not think about tomorrow, tonight!
Let’s just live the moment!
Oh, let’s not think about tomorrow, tonight!
