[ Introduction - Kobe Bryant]

"I want to be the best
I want to be the best, simple and plain.
That's why I play the game.
To be the best, you have to win...and that's what drives me"

"He's the best player in the game, it's just that simple. There's nothing that Kobe Bryant can't do.
He would defend your best player. He would shoot from the perimeter. He would get all in your monkey.
He would do whatever it takes. He is the most complete basketball player in the game today -- bar none.
He has an assassin's mentality. I said this week -- I said this when the trade went down and I'll repeat it again.
Who's starving more for an NBA World Championship more than Kobe Bryant? There is no one. This guy is highly motivated"

"What separates Kobe from the pack?"

"...More than Kobe Bryant? There is no one"

[Verse 1 - Lil' Wayne]

Okay
Kobe doing work
Two-four on my shirt
He the greatest on the court
And I'm the greatest on the verse
Going for the fourth ring like it was his first
Gotta get the gleam
Do it for Kareem
Two-Four
So nice, my flow so
Mean
Catch me at the game sitting next to Goldstein
Kobe brown Nike's purple gold strings
Kobe in the game dunking on the whole team
Black Mamba
Attack conquer
Basketball beast, rap monster
Cross over good, a turnaround jumper
Or just drive the lane and dunk on dunkers
You know where it's going, it's going down, yo
This is the Lake Show
But don't drown, though
I call him King Bryant now let the crown show

"Definitely, I'm just lost for words. He's definitely amazing"

Pass me the damn ball
I don't need a pick at all
And don't worry about my shot, cuz I will get that off
Yeah, I drop 40 on your double team
And I drop 81 on another team
Yeah, you better guard me with caution
And watch how I work him like an option
(Hehehe) No such thing as exhaustion
No time for resting
Cause I don't take breaks, I just break records
(Heh) and I prefer to ball with 3 seconds
And I bet we gon win it all in 3 seconds
Ya dig? That is a guarantee
Apparently
And please tell your defense don't ever man to man with me
Double team
Triple team
Your defense just tickle me
But, I never let them get to me
Literally
Step back and do him a 3
Ain't no defending me

"And one guy certainly envious the way Bryant plays lately, LeBron James"

[LeBron James]

"I've been ...he's definitely the best player in our league to me.
In my eyes, he's the best scorer in our league and I don't know...
there's not another guy in our league that can accomplish the things that's he's doing"

Never take a day off
Catch you at the top of the ..and get a J off
Baseline
Face time
Tongue out like Two-Three [Michael Jordan]
Ever Two-Three [LeBron James]
Gotta love I do me
Practice while you sleep
Practice in my sleep
Straight out of high school the bracket's made for me
I will be jumping over you like I got a mattress at my feet
All Phil Jackson's saying is that you better be passing it to me
I put the (master) in the (piece)
Attacking like a beast
And I am starving for victory and that means I'ma eat
When they ask you, "Who's the best?"
Then the answer should be me
(haha)

"Who's the best the NBA?"

"Oh, I say Kobe Bryant"

"Really? Why?"

"Cuz you never know what you're gonna get"

Call me mister clutch
Or mister automatic
I can go post them up
Or all of them in the alley
I'm going for the ring
I'm going for the ring
I went to Beijing
And came back with the bling
Who they want?
They want Kobe
And what he want?
He want the trophy
The victory
And the glory
No Shaq, no Robert Horry
Now break 'em off
Kobe break 'em off
Yeah, out better be where the Lakers dock, yeah
Yeah, just give them him the ball and he take it all, yeah
Or he probably out there dishing it to Gasol, yeah
Or give it to D. Fish. on the wing, yeah
Or just let lil' Ariza do his thing, yeah
Cuz I'm great and so is my team, yeah!

"Why don't you wanna be the greatest?"

Do it for Magic, it's your time, baby
I see thing wrong with doing it four times, baby
I'm the best, yes
And he's the best, yeah
Don't worry LeBron, get him next year
Now what's defense, to an assassin?
Killer instincts, murder the basket
Then steal the ball back, hold it for ransom
This more than a game, this is a passion
Been an all star been a champion
Free throw line, you hear them chanting
M.V.P.
M.V.P.
Kobe Bryant, aka Envy me
In knee deep
Smash any D'
Whoever he is, he can't guard me
Haha, he can't guard me

"So, there you have it, the overwhelming answer was Kobe Bryant"
