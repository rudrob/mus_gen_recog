tyga:

 i brought the snapback back, snapback back
 man all these niggas foul like hack-a-shaq
 nigga racks on racks my bitch ass so fat
 yo bitch booty like a pancake, flat flapjack
 i make your dollars collapse trail low in the strap
 shells big as a turtle master splinter to rap
 spin you like urkel your body hanging from fat
 thought you was sharper than tacks, get you thrown like some jacks
 all these bitches with these tassels on their titties tryna tax
 i don't give a fuck if none of yall don't rap
 i could pull a bitch just turning my back
 who knew that, venus trap
 flyest nigga in the class
 goyard bag, see that tag?
 i could pay your rent all year boy
 yo mama know, your cousin, sister brother and your mama know
 your cousin, sister brother and your mama know
 your cousin, sister brother and your mama know
 bitch, your granny know nigga

 I brought snapbacks back, snapback back
 that's all these niggas saying, i brought snapbacks back
 i'm a fresh as nigga, bitches know i'm the shit
 25 for my belt, nigga get off my dick
