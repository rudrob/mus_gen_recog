                    Tyre marks, tyre marks, finish line with the tyre marks
when the relay starts I’ma runaway slave
ugh, walking on water and running on waves
God MC I’ma guide you guide and see
there’s never no Ozzy me
if I hide and see, I’ma block away
fire marshalls moving in
marshmellows inside my pen
sweet sixteens, got sweet sixteen and they deadlier than sin
I’m so appalled, with a prototype with a guy now protocol
you an amateur, they wanna protocol
I damage ya on camera in Compton, in Canada
I don’t care where ya are
Just spit twice and I’m there where you are
like a shadow in the dark, you a paddle in the boat in an ocean of sharks bout to come up short
what in the park, throw crack rock, like bam bam n-gga have two grams n-gga pay your nook,
blam blam n-gga, have the black cam, dipset killa Cam n-gga
killers, been around sh-t but your momma and your bitch
shoved out the kush when your mom was like six
uncle bobby got the house ready back in 06
kick in the dough, K was in the kitchen way before I even heard of Mike Vick.
Mom in the bathroom poppa at work
happened on sunday we shoulda went to Church
look at my shirt, Polo on it
it’s gon sell if my logo on it
I fear no opponent, a demon come near and I might throw a spirit at the omen
You looking at the 2010 Romans
Empire, high Power HP, in ya face like HD
and I spit like a HK
I’ma shop like a H3 HUBCITYADNYG
problem aint hoody n-gga
tell the government come shoot me, n-gga
cause I’m oging out with a fist raised and a fist full of money give it to a fifth grade
drink a fifth of Hennessy and then take another fade with a democratic politician from CA
they don’t wanna see a B-L-A-C-K making some scratch like a hall of fame DJ
give us some free j’s put us in PJ’s
now we in the county jail calling for a threeway, God-Damn, your call
marketing base where the god damn barcode stuck in the street was dark like Harpo
black man tell me where your God-Damn heart go
although I’m in the land of milk and honey

nobody never gave me sh-t, when I got my first chain
all the n-ggas tried to take it from me
I had to fight back and sh-t
get it back and sh-t
and you rap n-ggas looking funny tryna talk back and sh-t
like he back that shit
acting like you real or something
n-gga aint popped no steel, aint popped no
go pop some pills or something
you trying real hard to appeal to summer
I’m being myself, my BFF is a BMW
with your BM in it and your stash box glove and a medicine that the doctor gave a n-gga wont help
I’m at the limit where I be amazing myself
I bet I finish at a level with a Black belt
I bet it everywhere every rapper get killed
bra,bra,bra, where da knife at, cut cut where ya life at
your careers over, he’s slumped over
everyone beating on, I’m sober
thats a new flow, (?) gave me some Kush and some Nuvo
new dough for the year and I sumo and I rap here
not a rapper, I’m a raptor, thats a T-Rex and a V-neck for the rapture
I’ma factor and your facial
I’m a fracture to a fraction
no one half and I hate math
Pastor’s like Eddie long, f-cking maricone
get me mighty low and get here
n-gga F-CK
