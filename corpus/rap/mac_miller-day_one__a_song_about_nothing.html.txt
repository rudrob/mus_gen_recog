                    (intro)
I made this beat
Uh,
Yeah
Alright I now wrote to it to
So would go like this
It’s like
Really late and germ’s tryin’ to get home
So I'mma try and one take a mofoking song

When you first start rapping everybody curious
Then you make it happen and everybody furious
Young kid curdy is, don’t know where the worry is
Wanna be burried in my pittsburgh jersey bitch
Nobody certain if you gonna make it
Life give you some hurtin’ and gonna hate it
Sometimes it leave you cold and it leave you naked
But, one thing for certain I'mma leave it fate is
Still young but I'm wonder when my time could be up
When my time come I'mma smiling peace up
Shorty sipping forties shanging out by the tree stump
So germ and me sorta making heads and it occured to me
You didn’t have to be like 33 to start earning cheese
Without certainty we in for eternity
Alot of style, a little money and some purple wig
Me and my queen my girl, not freddy mercury
‘cause first word for free, anything that getting older
Stand focus ’cause bullshit it was hopeless
So treat yourself like a damn professional
Your first music check, damn incredible
Every day feel like the best day ever
‘till every day feel like the best day ever
And you used to them days, kinda become a routine
You have it bad, wouldn’t fuck up a good dream
You realize that you’ll probably be away when
All the people die and you never get to say
And everything you always wanted to but never got the chance to
Start to weigh you down, what can a a man do
I could’ve stayed around, probably can
Sold a couple of shows, spend the last 2 years being down on the road
I guess, haven’t got to spend too much in my hometown
Is what you make up a play, don’t be mistaken
All of you shook can take it,
Broken beaten and wasted
Still i wouldn’t traded, and it was 5 o’clock
But my mind won’t stop
I’ve been thinking ’bout life pour syrop on pop
Smoke a cigarette, it’s like I’m really trying to die
Trying to keep my head on my shoulders
But my mind in the sky
I’m that moment when a gazelle and a lion collide
I’m a burned down doodle with a dominant side
Yup, independent platinum, wish you well passing
Juvi out of the ice age, bitch outta max ‘em
I’ll be right in this shit and just relaxin’
Let the time start passing

(outro)
Yeah
So I just make my own beat
And decided I was gonna rap one or two
It’s like, yup, took my chains off to rap this song
Uh,almost dropped my big chain
Who ever tought that I'd be standing in a booth with a big chain
Guys I'm joking I don’t have a verse
Alright pete
