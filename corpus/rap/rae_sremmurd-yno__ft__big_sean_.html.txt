                    [Hook - Slim Jimmy]
Used to have to eat cold meals
Now a nigga offin' gold seals
Countin' up money getting chills
We some young niggas on for real
Tokyo drift through the hills
Used to have to walk, no wheels
Now I'm buyin' whips for the crib
Young niggas on for real
Hunnid dollar bills
Young niggas on for real
Hunnid dollar bills
Young niggas on for real
Tokyo drift through the hills
Used to have to walk, no wheels
Cameras outside my crib
Young niggas on for real

[Verse 1 - Swae Lee]
I showed them bitches
Better than I ever could've told them bitches
Corduroys and Cartiers
Back then motherfuckers never shared my vision
But what you riding in a space ship?
And where your diamonds from? Saudi Arabia
Oh you don came up and put your niggas on
Now you got a crown and a chinchilla on
A1 since day one we stayed down so we came up
Some of them niggas won't make it with you
They'll lose hope and they'll change up
I can see these niggas hating
But as you can see the bad bitches love it
They wouldn't let us in the building back then
Now our names on the flyer on the cover

[Pre-Hook - Swae Lee]
I used to tell them I was gonna be something they just to look at me and laugh
All them hoes in the city don't really love you unless you got some cash
That's brand new paint nigga don't smudge it
Mofuckin pants cost 8 somthin'
That's my money so they can't say nothin'
That's my money so they won't say nothin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Slim Jimmy]
Young niggas on
Pull up on your ass unannounced in a foreign I don't know where I'm going
HIt the gas, can I hear the engine running (nope)
Living fast I ain't thinking about tomorrow (nope)
Used to be a nigga want 20 inch rims
Now we got accountants out here for Rae Sremm
All up in the mall Neiman Marcus shopping
Came a long way from them out of street apartments
Everybody got a dream that they chase
And everybody got a motherfucking hater
They wanna see your dreams burn to ashes
I can't wait to see their faces when I pass them (skrrr)
Boy you should taken a young nigga serious
Now a young niggas on for real
They wasn't fucking with a young nigga then
They can't fuck with a young nigga still

[Pre-Hook - Slim Jimmy]
I used to tell them I was gonna be something they just to look at me and laugh
All them hoes in the city don't really love you, until you count cash
That's brand new paint nigga don't smudge it
Mofuckin pants cost 8 hundrid'
That's my money, bitch, you can't say nothin'
That's my money, bitch, you can't have nothin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Look, moving in slow-mo
But I still get it way faster then you so you never would know though
She slowing it down just to ask for a photo
Just know that I'm fuckin I may be for sure though
Soldiers on me like I'm fresh out the dojo
She think I'm beautiful chocolate skin cocoa
Don't get it fucked up put your ass in a chokehold
Players only live once so I wear Polo
Polo, polo, polo, polo
My girl is from SoCal my outfit from Soho
And I got dough, that shit is stashed in the crib
And it won't leave the house like it's fucking DiGiorno
Hell yeah nigga that's all me
I'm from where big problems get handled with a small fee
Started with the squad now I got the whole team tight
I stuck to the plot stuck to the script and I don't even screen right

[Hook]
