                    Homie you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Homie you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Homie you's a window shopper
At the dealership trying to get a test drive
Homie you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

Everybody wanna talk shit on the internet
But they ain't understand they see the work I put into it
I'm guessing all this bullshit just come with the benefits
20 years old, 20 carats my bezel heavy
Doors suicide they say a word in remembrance
And they just wanna see me fail but dawg I ain't havin' it
They wanna tear me down and tell you "youngin' you can't handle it"
And I'm just here to tell em their shit never happenin'
And I just flew by in a drop-top Porsche
Givenchy swim shorts like I hopped out the pool
Flu game pose people callin' me the G.O.A.T
People gettin' heated shit my rollie still cold
Aye-ye-ye
I got cha-ay-ay-ange
Why you even lookin'? You ain't pay-ay-in'
I'm still loyal what the fuck is ya'll sayin'?
Even though my song stuck in your bitch brain
