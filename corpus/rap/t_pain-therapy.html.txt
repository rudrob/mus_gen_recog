[Talking:]
Ahhh... Take a sip of this... eh, let's go (yay)
I want you to feel this beat baby, come on girl let's go

Listen, (what's up), this ain't the way I wanted it to end
But I got to go
Gotta get missing
You ain't gotta kick me out
I'll get out my own house
But you still need to get your s*** together girl

What do I do, what do I say
Gotta get us back to the way
That we used to be back in the day
Who do I call to talk to
Shawty, you ain't gotta be scared of me
All we need is therapy

Like 1, 2, 3, 4 get the hell up out my door
5, 6, 7, 8 I don't need your sex, I'll masturbate
9, 10, 11, 12 you can go to hell all I care, yeah

Can't do it shawty, can't deal with you babe
Can't handle the pressure of you (yeah yeah)
Can't do it shawty, can't deal with you babe
Can't handle the pressure of you (yeah yeah)

Listen, (what's up), I know you ain't used to us being friends
But I got to go
No more kissing
You ain't got to go away
But I know I cannot stay
Cause you still gotta get your s*** together girl

What do I do, what do I say
Gotta get us back to the way
That we used to be back in the day
Who do I call to talk to
Shawty, you ain't gotta be scared of me
All we need is therapy

Like 1, 2, 3, 4 get the hell up out my door
5, 6, 7, 8 I don't need your sex, I'll masturbate
9, 10, 11, 12 you can go to hell all I care, yeah

Can't do it shawty, can't deal with you babe
Can't handle the pressure of you (yeah yeah)
Can't do it shawty, can't deal with you babe
Can't handle the pressure of you (yeah yeah)

Ew you too much pressure doll
You gonna raise my cholesterol
I gotta lower the phone, decibels
Just to talk, just a thought
I'm gonna get a girl with a ass just as soft
Who swear man dolls like reservoir
And I was mister pink
Remember those nights on the kitchen sink
I was choking you in a good way, good way
Now we in the streets and I'm choking you in a hood way
When the cops come what I could say
You know how all that gossip is
Next morning box of perez
Any girl I take out media take care of
I need a break now
Before I break now

Show me your janet jacksons if you nasty
You said you want to cut my nuts off like jesse jackson, classy
Ew, why she say that ouch
Bitch, give me back my couch
And that same couch cashed in
Now listen to t-pain sing

Like 1, 2, 3, 4 you can get up out my door
5, 6, 7, 8 I don't need your sex, I'll masturbate
9, 10, 11, 12 you can go to hell all I care, yeah

Can't do it shawty, can't deal with you babe
Can't handle the pressure of you (yeah)
Can't do it sawty, can't deal with you babe
Can't handle the pressure of you
