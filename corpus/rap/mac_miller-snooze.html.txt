                    Get some brand new kicks,
Couple hundred on the jeans,
I been spendin all this money got me feelin like a g,
Hand me down gear, some shit you never seen,
Droppin three stacks now, so fresh so clean,
See we never coulda dreamed of,
All of the shit me and my team does,
Girls see me like damn you look good now you cleaned up,
Feelin fresh got my teeth brushed,
Ima new kid been waiting to do this,
They hatin up on my plate got some steak and its rocris,
Been feelin like a true pimp Biatch,
It’s 05′ i’m the steelers you the seahawks,
This weed I keep hittin makin me cough,
Jolly giant, i’m jack smokin the bean stock,
I get hoes in boat shoes,
Now I won’t lose, welcome to the old school bitch

[Chorus]
Now my clothes look cleaner,
And my kicks look fly,
We be buyin more reefer so my crew gettin high,
Now the girls keep callin and the money keep comin
I be jumpin off the bridge but, Ima hit the ground runnin
When the f-ck will I wake up,
I Ask em when the f-ck will I wake up,
Cause every single day their suttin new to do,
So I’ma keep on dreamin hit snooze.

[Mac Miller Verse 2]
Hit snooze I aint tryna wake up yet,
Ima keep on dreamin be the straight up best,
And i’m blessed
Everyday and I’m getting straight up fresh,
My homies like Mac damn you get your cake up yes I did
That’s the life I live I grind all day,
High School sellin mixtapes in the hallway,
I bet they never thought I’d be this cool,
Now they understand why I skip school,
Had my dreams wasn’t worried at all,
This– from gettin bored I go splurge at the mall,
I got money, I got bitches,
I got everything they dreamin of and I aint done shit yet,
This major leagues big business,
Used to have a wish list,
Now I just give gifts,
Shit would make me happy,
Here’s how to reach me,
You can get at me,

[Chorus]
Now my clothes look cleaner,
And my kicks look fly,
We be buyin more reefer so my crew gettin high,
Now the girls keep callin and the money keep comin
I be jumpin off the bridge but, Ima hit the ground runnin
When the fuck will I wake up,
I Ask em when the fuck will I wake up,
Cause every single day their suttin new to do,
So ima keep on dreamin hit snooze.

When the fuck will I wake up,
I ask em when the fuck will I wake up
Cause every single day their suttin new to do,
So ima keep on dreamin hit snooze.

Now my clothes look cleaner,
And my kicks look fly,
We be buyin more reefer so my crew gettin high,
Now the girls keep callin and the money keep comin
I be jumpin off the bridge but, Ima hit the ground runnin
When the fuck will I wake up,
I Ask em when the fuck will I wake up,
Cause every single day their suttin new to do,
So ima keep on dreamin hit snooze.
