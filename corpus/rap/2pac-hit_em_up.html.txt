                    I ain't got no motherfuckin' friends
So I fucked your bitch
You fat motherfucker
{Take money}
West side!
Bad Boy killers
{Take money}
You know the realist is niggas
We bring it to
{Take money}

[Strofa 1 – Tupac]

First off, fuck your bitch
And the click you claim
West side, when we ride
Come equipped with game
You claim to be a player
But I fucked your wife
We bust on Bad Boys
Niggas fucked for life
Plus, Puffy tryin' to see me weak
Hearts I rip
Biggie Smalls and Junior Mafia
Some mark ass bitches
We keep on comin'
While we runnin' for your jewels
Steady gunning, keep on busting at the fools
You know the rules
Lil’ Ceaser, go ask ya homie
How I leave you
Cut your young ass up
See you in pieces
Now be deceased
Lil’ Kim,
Don't fuck around with real G's
Quick to snatch your ugly ass off the streets
So fuck peace
I'll let them niggas know
It's on for life
Don't let the west side
Ride the night
Bad Boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck wit' me and get ya caps peeled
You know, see

[Refren]

Grab your glocks when you see 2Pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac, uh
Who shot me,|but you punks didn't finish
Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga, I hit 'em up

[Przerywnik – Tupac]

Check this out
You motherfuckers know what time it is
I don't know why I'm even on this track
Y'all niggas ain't even on my level
I'ma let my little homies ride on you
Bitch made-ass bad boy bitches!

[Strofa 2 – Hussein]

Get out the way, yo!
Get out the way, yo!
Biggie Smalls just got dropped
Little Moo' passed the Mac
And let me hit him in his back
Frank White need to get spanked right
For setting traps
Little accident murderer
And I ain't never heard of ya
Poisonous gats attack when I'm serving ya
Spank the shank
Your whole style when I gank
Gaurd your rank
Cause I'm a slam your ass in a pang
Puffy weaker than the fuckin' block
I'm running through, nigga
And I'm smoking Junior Mafia
In front of you, nigga
With the ready power
Tucked in my guess
Under my Eddie Bower
Your clout petty sour
I push packages ever hour
And hit 'em up

[Refren]

Grab your glocks when you see 2Pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac, uh
Who shot me,|but you punks didn't finish
Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga, we hit 'em up

[Strofa 3 – Tupac]

Peep how we do it
Keep it real
It's penitentiary steel
This ain't no freestyle battle
All you niggas getting killed
With your mouths open
Tryin' to come up off of me
You and the clouds hoping
Smoking dope is like a Sherm-high
Niggas think they learned to fly
But they burned, motherfucker
You deserve to die
Talking 'bout you getting money
But it's funny to me
All you niggas livin' bummy
While you fucking with me
I'm a self-made millionaire
Thug livin' out of prison
Pistols in the air
Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on the couch
And beg the bitch to let you sleep on the house?
Now it's all about Versace
You copied my style
Five shots couldn't drop me
I took it and smiled
Now I'm 'bout to set the record straight
With my AK
I'm still the thug that you love to hate
Motherfucker, I hit 'em up

[Strofa 4 – Kadafi]

I'm from N-E-W Jers'
Where plenty of murders occurs
No points to come
We bring drama to all you herds
Knuckle, check the scenario
Little Ceas’, I'll bring you fake G's to your knees
Coppin' please, cause this ain't your area
Lil’ Kim, is you coked up, or doped up?
Get your little Junior Whopper click smoked up
What the fuck?
Is you stupid?
I take money
Crash and mash through Brooklyn
With my click looting, shooting and polluting your block
With fifteen shot
Cocked glock to your knot
Outlaw Mafia click movin' up another notch
And you bast stops squaws get mopped and dropped
All your fake-ass East Coast props
Brainstormed and locked

[Strofa 5 – EDI Amin]

Youse a beat biter
A Pac style taker
I'll tell you to your face
You ain't no shit, but a faker
Softer than Alize with a chaser
'Bout to get murdered for the paper
EDI Amin approach the scene of the caper
Like a loc
With Little Ceas' in a choke
Huh, totin' smoke
We ain't no motherfucking joke
Thug Life, niggers better be known
Be approaching
In the wide open, gun smoking
No need for hoping
It's a battle lost
I got 'em crossed
As soon as the funk is bopping off
Nigga, I hit 'em up

[Zakończenie – Tupac mówi]

Now you tell me who won
I see them, they run
They don't wanna see us
{Take money}
Whole Junior Mafia click
Dressing up tryin' to be us
{Take money}
How the fuck they gonna be the Mob
When we're always on our job
{Take money}
We're millionaires
Killing ain't fair
{Take money}
But somebody got to do it
Oh yeah, Mobb Deep
{Take money}
You wanna fuck with us?
You little young ass motherfuckers
{Take money}
Don't one of you niggas got sickle-cell or somethin'?
{Take money}
You're fucking with me, nigga
You fuck around and have a seizure or heart-attack
{Take money}
You better back the fuck up
Before you get smacked the fuck up
That's how we do it on our side
Any of you niggas from New York that wanna bring it
Bring it
But we ain't singing
We bringin' drama
Fuck you and your motherfuckin' mama
We gonna kill all you motherfuckers
Now when I came out
I told you it was just about Biggie
Then everybody had to open their mouth
With a motherfuckin' opinion
Well, this is how we gonna do this:
Fuck Mobb Deep, fuck Biggie
Fuck Bad Boy as a staff, record label
And as a motherfucking crew
And if you want to be down with Bad Boy
Then fuck you too
Chino XL, fuck you too
All you motherfuckers, fuck you too!
{Take money, take money}
All of y'all motherfuckers
Fuck you, die slow, motherfucker
My .44 (Magnum) make sure all your kids don't grow
You motherfuckers can't be us or see us
We're motherfuckin' Thug Life riders
West side till we die
Out here in California, nigga
We warned ya'
We'll bomb on you motherfuckers
We do our job
You think you're the mob, nigga
We're the motherfuckin' mob
Ain't nuttin' but killers
And the real niggas
All you motherfuckers feel us
Our shit goes tripple and four quadruple
{Take money}
You niggas laugh cause our staff got guns
Under their motherfuckin' belts
You know how it is and we drop records they felt
You niggas can't feel it
We're the realist
Fuck 'em
We're Bad Boy killers.
