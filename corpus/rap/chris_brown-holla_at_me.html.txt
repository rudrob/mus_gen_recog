Uh, Boom, Boom
We ballin’ in the room
Sweepin’ up my competition call me Mr. broom
knockin’ n-ggas over, call me bulldozer,
one more drink for these b-tches and it’s over,
cause i’m a strike that something like a cobra,
I know she want my venom, but I ain’t gon’ leave it in her,
and right after I get her, she know she with a winner,
and we straight to the crib, I ain’t takin’ her to dinner,
n-gga look at my jewels,
aviator shades I ain’t lookin’ at you,
Ah chu, bless me twice,
be a rich n-gga I be sh-ttin’ on your life,
magazine covers, magneem rubbers,
I mean magnum, I don’t f-ck with stragglers,
n-ggaz want drama, Gangsta Grillz bastards
did you check the caption, lights camera, action

[Chorus]
Holla at Me Boo, Holla at Me Baby, (x3)
I’m Turnt Up, I’m Super Turnt Up

[Chris Brown - Verse 2]
a n-gga beep beep
and shawty toot, toot,
blowin’ out there brains, car need a new roof,
lookin’ like a superstar, when I roll through
and shawty I’m the truth, so mama what it do?
now let’s ride out, ain’t no trippin’
when we dippin’ to my hide-out,
big dipper cause you sippin’ on my bottle
only f-ckin’ with them A-listin’ models,
now let’s get it like ..
Low fitted if you done it then I did it
if you kick it, then i’m with it
we can do this sh-t all-night
your minute don’t compare to my limit
when i’m in it
and I get it
i’m a give it to you all night,

I’m the sh-t yeah I go hard,
don’t stand in lines n-gga I bogard
Bad boy celebrity cause I’m so large
and don’t need no battery cause I’m in charge

[Chrous]

[Tyga - Verse 3]
(Ha)

Don’t say sh-t, get your face-lift
Rose rich let tha champagne drip,

snap back them ain’t even rare, where the tag at,

yellow n-gga, no cabs
Got the phantom out, no mask,
get your camera out uh, one flash,
hot beams steady shot clap your a-s,
Aww, T. raw I’m so ahh,

patron top wash straight from the liquor store,
I’m turnt up I can’t feel my face, so…

[Chorus]
Hey (x3)
[End]
