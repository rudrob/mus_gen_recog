                    For you baby, I'd find you (4x) 
You wouldn't get far 

[The Game] 
I done been around the world, been around the block 
Been around hoes that fucked Biggie and 'Pac 
Like Vida Guerrera, ass took her to the top 
She'll give you some brains you let her throw up the Roc 
Let her put on your chain, she'll throw you some cock 
Picture that like Meagan Good and Jamie Foxx 
Hype said it's a wrap, she still on the set 
Putting oil on her likes like she Gloria Velez 
She was Eye Candy in the XXL 
Hopped off the page and on a skateboard with Pharrell 
I knew she {"wouldn't get far"} cause five hundred dollars 
can't get you that {"far"} how you get that {"far"} 
And all these new video bitches trying to be Melissa Ford 
But they don't know Melissa Ford drive a Honda Accord 
She a video vixen, but behind closed doors 
She do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards 
Ha ha 

[Chorus: The Game] 
{"You wouldn't get far"} Fucking them rap stars 
You know who you are, put your hands up ladies 
{"You wouldn't get far"} If you kept your legs closed 
{"It would be best to wait your turn"} But you know 
{"You wouldn't get far"} Fucking them rap stars 
You know who you are, I wrote this song for you 
{"For you baby, I'd find you"} For you 
And you, for alla y'all 

[Kanye West] 
For you... uhh.. 

Pop quiz, how many topless, black foxes 
did I have under my belt, like boxers 
Not to brag but, if it add up 
One, two, nigga that's mad nuts 
Game you mad nuts, how you gon' call out all these 
bitches knowing damn well they gon' call me? 
The only dream, of that ghetto prom queen 
was to make it to the screen, maybe get seen 
Maybe get chose by a nigga from my team 
Head so good he don't ask for a pre.. nup 
Now ask yourself this question, umm 
Would you be with Jay-Z if he wasn't C-E-O 
Would you be with F-A-B-O if he drove a Neo 
Would you ride with Ne-Yo, if he was in a Geo 
Well why the hell you think these bitches coming at me fo'? 
But since they all fall in my palm, I take a trio 
Yo 

[Chorus - sub "mouth closed" for "legs closed"] 

[The Game] 
I done had my share of bitches with long hair 
Short doo like Kalissa, Halle in "Boomerang" yeah 
I been around the block in the Bentley drop top 
In Miami Beach when Lil' Kim was fucking with Scott 
I got the scoop on Hoops, whatever the case 
She'll let you spray in her face long as she Bathing Apes 
And ain't nobody trying to take Beyonce from Jay 
But I know a bitch named Superhead he fucked back in the day 
The things niggaz do when pussy sitting on they face 
Stabbed Un in the stomach 
She must have had a pussy like Wonder Woman, on that superhero shit 
Fly as Gabrielle Union in the back of my six, fo' 
Impala, forget the double D's 
I put 'em right in your face like that model bitch Takara 
And she ain't win the show but she riding in that Galata 
That's why I fuck 'em today and forget 'em tomorrow 

[Chorus] 

[The Game] 
God damn! Y'knahmsayin? 
I'm sitting back watching Kanye video 
And I see the same bitch that was in the homeboy Busta Rhymes video 
Then I flip the muh'fuckin channel 
Checking out my uncle Snoop Dogg video 
And I see the same BITCH, that was in my video! Y'knowhatI'msayin? 
And then y'knahmsayin, to make that even mo' fucked up 
I'm watching Oprah cover Hurricane Katrina 
I see the same bitch on Oprah, floating away on the hood of a Camry 
That was in the nigga Lil Weezy video! 
I mean DAMN! Everywhere I look 
Everywhere I go I see the same hoes 
Don't get mad, I'm only being real 
Yeah
