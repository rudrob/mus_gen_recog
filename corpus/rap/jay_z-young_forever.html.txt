                    [Mr. Hudson]
Let's dance in style
Let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit
Life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

[Chorus]
Forever young
I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever,
forever, and ever? (Uhh)
Forever young (Young)
I wanna be (Aye, may the best of your todays...
Forever young (Be the worst of your tomorrows...
Do you really want to live forever, (But we ain't even thinkin that far...Ya kna what i mean?)
Forever, forever young

[Jay-z]
So we livin life like a video
Where the sun is always out and you never get old
and the champaign is always cold
and the music is always good
and the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
and they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
without a wrinkle in today
cuz there's no tomorrow
just a picture perfect day
that last a whole lifetime
and it never ends
cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment smoke some weed drink some wine
Reminisce talk some shit forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark they can't erase, Neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut, I'll be fine
I'm forever young



[Chorus]
Forever young
I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever,
forever, and ever
Forever young
I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever,
forever, forever young

[Jay-z]
Fear not where, fear not why, fear not much while we're alive
Life is for living not living uptight
til you're somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die I'll be alive for a million years bye bye's are not for legends i'm forever young my name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over Pyrex pots, My name shall be passed down to generations while debatin' up in barber shops
Young slung, hung here, showed that a nigga from here, With a little ambition, just what we can become here.
And as the father pass the story down to his son's ear younger get younger every year (yeah)
So if you love me baby this is how you let me know, Don't ever let me go, thats how you let me know, baby

[Chorus]
Forever young
I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever,
forever, forever
Forever young
I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever,
forever, forever young

[Jay-z sings]
Slammin' Bentley doors,
hoppin' outta Porsche's
Poppin' Up on Forbes' list
Gorgeous (hold up,)
Niggas thought I lost it
They be talking bullshit,
I be talking more shit,
They nauseous, (hold up) I'll be here forever
You know I'm on my four shit
I ain't with foreclosure
I will never forfeit
Less than four bars
Guru bring the chorus in
Did you get the picture yet?
I'm painting you a portrait of Young


[Chorus]
Forever young
I wanna be
Forever young (Forever young)
Do you really want to live forever
forever, forever young
