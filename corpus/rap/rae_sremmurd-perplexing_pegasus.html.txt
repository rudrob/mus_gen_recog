                    Ear Drummers
Mike WiLL Made-It

Jump in the Pegasus
All kinda reckless the necklace
All kinda reckless I flexed it
K-keep the change, yeah you heard me correctly
If she sleek and foreign, call her Lexus
Every week a foreign, I just check her wishlist
Only thing I'm here for is perplexin'
Caterpillar whip and I lowered it

Lil' Jxm', I got a problem
I'm in love with money, I'm in love with ballin'
Gotta keep my phone on vibrate, how these bitches callin'
Neiman Marcus' shawty and I ain't with no shoppin'
2K on my feet, yeah, 2K, I be kickin' game
Bubble Gum on Jxm', smokin' on a different strain
Niggas still in south, they need to stay up in their lane
Baby, we on top and that ain't ever gonna change
Put you boys to shame
Pull them foreign's out
And put you boys to shame
Going hard on a bitch like Major Payne
Say my name (Jxm')
They ain't know how to spell it, so I put it on my chain

Jump in the Pegasus
All kinda reckless the necklace
All kinda reckless I flexed it
K-keep the change, yeah you heard me correctly
If she sleek and foreign, call her Lexus
Every week a foreign, I just check her wishlist
Only thing I'm here for is perplexin'
Caterpillar whip and I lowered it

All these, hundreds got me siftin'
Jeep 35, needs a liftkit
Man dirty cup I'm grippin' I mean it's a kick-in
Leave your chick within 5 feet of me, wouldn’t risk it
Niggas cannot stop me, told them just to face it
Aston sittin' low, wow, damn I scraped it
She like spreading wings, 'cause it's the Pegasus
I'm like "I might go and take the spot, because of negligence"
Barricades ain't holdin' me
Money on me, but that ain't controllin' me
Last night had bitches go at me, like they go at me?
Took off all these niggas, call it jetstream

Jump in the Pegasus
All kinda reckless the necklace (yeah)
All kinda reckless I flexed it (yeah)
K-keep the change, yeah, you heard me correctly
If she sleek and foreign, call her Lexus
Every week a foreign, I just check her wishlist (yeah)
Only thing I'm here for is perplexing (yeah)
Caterpillar whip and I lowered it (yeah)
