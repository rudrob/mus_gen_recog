                    It's bad boy bitch 

Do it to it 

P- It feels good to be back, I missed ya 
Relax ya mind, let your conscience be free 
and I'm rolling with the sounds of BBE 
(Do it to it) 
you know what time it is 
report to the dance floor 

N- It's bad boy bitch 

P- Talk to 'em 

See you at the corner of my eye, 
Leanin on the wall, lookin' fly 
(I) I (Want) want (You) you (To) to (Come) come 
(Be) be with me

but I don't wanna rush, 
I am here and will u make your move 

I see you, I am me, I want cha, why don't cha

Come to know me 
Wanna come, come get to know me 
Come to show me (Repeat) 
Show me you wanna know me 

You know what it is 
Im back in the buildin’ 
You know who it is 
security strapped, still stackin a million 
Its double the stallion, somethin’ Italian 
Or maybe Puerto Rican, you can catch me in Paris 
Im in it to win it, I'm willin to carry 
The game, if you think im not Look at you carriage 
Pop up clean about in a Phantom 
The people go screamin like an opera anthem 
I did it before 
I’d do it again 
I got it to blow, got it to spin 
Lies before, cool as the wind 
Got hits go back like juice 'n' jin, yeah 
Shine the best and diamond necklace 
My extravagant taste, the style perplexes 
They know im the shit, they wanna get next 
That’s why she had a fit cuz she wanted to get next to his 

I'm here, when will you make your move 
I see you, I am me, I want cha, why don't cha 
come to me, I can be, what you need oh baby 
Im standin', been waitin', I’m yearnin’ im burnin’ 
Come to know me 
Wanna come, come get to know me 
Come to show me (Repeat) 
Show me you wanna know me 

Anywhere I care 
They all stop and stare 
Admire your body language speak loud and clear like 
N- I WANT YOU TO COME BE WITH ME 

She be waitin’, anticipatin’ for oh so long 
Fantasising wild thoughts of me comin on like 
N- I'M HERE WHEN WILL YOU MAKE YOUR MOVE 

she diggin my style, my swag, my suede, my swirve 
My way with words, the Boys absurd for sure 
You cant fall till my aura call 
I make miracles like I walk on water 
What cha want mama order 
Its on my tab 
Im so bad with the cash 
I dropped the whole bag 
where you at girl 

I'm here, when will you make your move 
I see you, I am me, I want cha, why don't cha 
come to me, I can be, what you need oh baby 
Im standin', been waitin', I’m yearnin’ im burnin’ 
get to know me, come get to know me 
Come show me (Repeat) 

I'm here right now 
Cant wait no more no 
You are the one who stole my heart 
Cant you see the way to fall back.. (?) 
I need you to come closer 
This feeling is getting stormy 
Really got me hot 

I see you, I am me, I want cha, why don't cha 
come to me, I can be, what you need oh baby 
Im standin', been waitin', I’m yearnin’ im burnin’ 
Come to know me 
Wanna come, come get to know me 
Come to show me (Repeat) 
Show me you wanna know me 

P- Do it to it 
N- Why don't cha come to me

Relax ya mind, let your conscience be free
