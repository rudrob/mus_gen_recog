                    Getting lifted, feeling right
 Double cup, dirty Sprite
 Baddest bitch, you know she mine
 But you know I don’t love ‘em, and you know I don’t cuff ‘em, no

 On the West side tryna feel the breeze
 On a mission tryna fuck with OHB
 She say she fell in love with the G in me
 And she loving, she loving
 You know I got the homies parked right outside
 I’m in the blood red Lambo, yeah the what up 5
 Got the killers and the bitches that be ready to ride
 Cause they loving, they loving

 Picture me rollin' 64 sitting on track
 Picture me rollin' top down, switching lanes
 Picture me rollin' from VA to LA
 Picture me rollin', picture me rollin', aw yeah

 Rolled my weed up for the night, I'm tryna smoke, aw yeah
 See them cops, you know we like too far, woah yeah
 If you don't smoke girl, it's alright, and I ain't worred 'bout a damn thing
 That's more for me so I don't mind, I don't mind, oh

 On the West side tryna feel the breeze
 On a mission tryna fuck with OHB
 She say she fell in love with the G in me
 And she loving, she loving
 You know I got the homies parked right outside
 I’m in the blood red Lambo, yeah the what up 5
 Got the killers and the bitches that be ready to ride
 Cause they loving, they loving

 Picture me rollin' 64 sitting on track
 Picture me rollin' top down, switching lanes
 Picture me rollin' from VA to LA
 Picture me rollin', picture me rollin', aw yeah

 All night long, play it if this your song
 All night long, play it if this your song
 All night long, play it if this your song
 All night long, play it if this your song

 Picture me rollin', Forgiatos on the Wraith, 64 sitting on track
 Picture me rollin' from Virginia to the Bay, top down, switching lanes
 Picture me rollin' private jet on the red eye, from VA to LA
 Picture me rollin', 500, picture me rollin', aw yeah

 Whole bunch of money in the safe
 I got a chopper outside for a rainy day
 I dirty, dirty, yeah keep it on my waist
 Call me the baker man, I'm making all the cake
 I got a bitch with an attitude problem
 I know she crazy but I know that pussy awesome
 Top down, riding round, nigga who are you?
 I got ups bitch, what can Brown do for you? Picture me rollin', aw yeah
