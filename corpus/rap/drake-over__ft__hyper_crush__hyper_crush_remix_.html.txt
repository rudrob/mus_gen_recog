Hyper Crush Remix

Hyper Crush in this bitch until it's over-ver-ver-ver
Hyper Crush in this bitch until it's over-over-ver

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We been everywhere and back
But, what am I doin'? What am I doin'?
What am I doin'?
Oh, yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me
I'm doin me
I'm livin' life right now, mayne
And this what I'm a do 'til it's over
'Til it's over
But it's far from over...
Far-far-from over

Bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinkin'?
Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'
'Bout to set it off, set it off, in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't've drove, tell me how I'm gettin' home
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
'Bout to go Thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas

I'm 'bout to cold Vanilla Ice,
White, Rappin' for a livin'
That's the passion that I give 'em
Sarcasm so they listen.
My flow is so hyper,
The club is what we crush.
And I'm focused like a sniper.
We ain't over 'til it's done. (done)

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We been everywhere and back
But, what am I doin'? What-what am I doin'?
What am I doin'?
Oh, yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me
I'm doin me
I'm livin' life right now, mayne
And this what I'm a do 'til it's over
'Til it's over
But it's far from over...
Far-far-from over

M-m-message on my beeper
Make them a believer
'Bout to do it big in this bitch
Clean the [?]
I came here to dance
Everybody's acting cool
'Bout to teach them who runs shit,
Back to School.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hyper Crush in this bitch until it's over.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hyper Crush in this bitch until it's over-ver.

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year, who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We been everywhere and back
But, what am I doin'? What am I doin'?
What am I doin'?
Oh, yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me
I'm doin me
I'm livin' life right now, mayne
And this what I'm a do 'til it's over
'Til it's over
But it's far from over...
Far-far-from over
