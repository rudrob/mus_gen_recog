                    Uh, chya! uh, uh
 Dedicated too, this dedicated too
 Fuck it

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
 Uh, I got a pocket full of posies
 Some devil with a pitchfork keep talkin’ like he know me
 I’m psychopathic, low key, my hyperactive dome piece
 Get no sleep, ill as fuck, the hospitals seem so weak
 I stood before an Angel as he told me bout the glory
 Put me in a room of people, how the fuck could I be lonely
 I only get money, these lables tryna clone me
 Uh, my thoughts get heavy, hit the ground and crack the concrete
 So, I try to keep em’ in my head
 It’s sad to see when everything that you believe is dead
 Word to Heavy D, and rest in peace to all that come and pass
 Life is good sometimes, but it just doesn’t last
 A bunch of tracks, you see this mic is like my punchin’ bag
 Rock n’ Roll, drugs and cash, you softer than a bubble bath
 Sucka ass mothafucka, muthafucka’s venom and
 Doper than the shit that put Chris Tucker in Dead Presidents
 Desert rhymes, homie, ridin’ beats, I’m on a camel
 I’m way too hot to handle, life a beach, I brought my sandals
 Haha, you want a war ? I got a lot of ammo
 You ain’t a soldier cause you rockin’ cammo
 Young Rambo, hundred million fans though
 And I do it big, you a Ipod Nano
 Fire on wax, look like I rock candles
 Yeah you got a show, but you ain’t on my channel

That’s HBO bitch, you gotta pay for that
 Hahaha, your channels free

I’m gunna fuckin’ kill you

Um, Imax’n shit motherfucker
 Yeah, suck my dick

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
 Hey, ayo, I’m bout to start gambilin’ with Ambien
 I’m dutch smokin’, that’s a strike
 But fuck bowlin’, I could tear a pin of Maryland
 See, I’m American, apparently it’s damagin’
 To be in front of cameras in your underwear with Marilyn
 Monroe, look at dumb hoes who want to much dough
 And come close to have you straight trippin’ when you jump rope
 Don’t rock the love boat, this business fuckin’ cut throat
 And it’s gunna crack is you just paint the wall with one coat
 Rooms filled with blunt smoke, peep me through the fog
 These rappers who be hatin’ probably need to get a job
 See, me I’m with my squad, gettin’ money, livin’ comfortable
I know a couple hoes who model, but they ugly though
 Fuck a toast, y’all is fuckin’ broke, cut ya throat
 Judgin’ me is nothin’ dope, boy you lyin’ under oath
 God made the world, why did man make the scriptures?
 And if he created Lennon, why’d he go and make a Hitler?
 I could take a photo, but I’d rather paint a picture
 Of the one Laurence Fishburne, we’ll shoot up all you hipsters
 I’m from Pittsburgh, that’s black and gold
 If my skin gets filled up, I’mma tat my soul
 Runnin’ out of paper, writin’ on my hand
 Hundred thousand haters writin’ bout my jams
 Want a number one independent album? I’m your man
 I’mma hit Preme and leave you all right where you stand
