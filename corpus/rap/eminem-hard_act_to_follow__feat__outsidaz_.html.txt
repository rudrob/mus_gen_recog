                    [Intro]
Ha ha ha haaaa!
Yeah, what the fuck
Outsidaz, we be a hard act to follow
We be a hard act to follow
We be a hard act to follow
Yeah, baby
Hard act to follow
Ha, yeah
So come on and come on
So come on and come on
So come on…

[Verse 1: Young Zee]
Ya, ya
And I’m the block border outlaw like 2Pac (?)
Still no cops, the neighborhood watch would stop me
I’m like the Lassie driving in the God’s G
The God’s peace full of civilized God’s P
Our believers fall off 2000 leavers
Meddin‘ all needles in the mood, they’re all evil
Thou bury now, hear me?
Outsidaz, we all scary
Shell Barry from the hell’s fairy
Fuck Barry off 51 Cherry, gun, Chevy
Tatting on the willy with the Chuck cherry
Come on

[Verse 2: Pacewon]
I got a big mouth, (?)
I whip my dick out
And mouth-slap you and make you kiss my owl tattoo
And leave you with wet stains until you bleed red rain
And for the next day you’ll need fucking X-rays for your chest pains
The Outz surgeon for trick, so I butt around
Fuck the quarter pound, bitch, we lock this corner down
In affect, you’ll be robing in a black deep coke
I’ll eat gold and flip the remote while you main bitch do me a deep throat
And what is wrong with y’all can’t get along until I’m dead and born?
Dug ya on, get shittin‘ on
Come on now

[Hook]
We be the hard act to follow (Follow!)
We the hard act to follow (follow)
We be the hard act to follow (Follow!)
We the hard act to follow (Follow!)
(Hard act to follow) Follow!
A hard act to follow (follow)
Outsidaz, come on!

[Verse 3: Azz-Iz]
Azz-Iz high and stays high
(?)
The raw rasta, (?)
Burn ‘em (?)
C’mon!

[Verse 4: Slang Ton]
(?)
I smoke more than 50 chimney hatchets
(?)

[Verse 5: Eminem]
Product of espionage
Pissed drunk on pepsi and Scotch
Sticking my fucking foot up a lesbian's crotch while pedestrians watch
Gansters bow down to a mightier villian
There might be a million outsidaz
Hiding on the side of your building
Say goodbye to your children
Notify your next to kin
Bring some extra men
If anyone on your team expects to win
The effects of gin made me a smart ass with a bossy mouth
Six bouncers had to come and toss me out some coffee house
It ain't a riddle
After you flat line in the hospital
While I'm in the middle row at your funeral wake
Fucking your widow
Someone call the nurse and tell her to strap me down I need a harness
I bleed bizarreness
Spitting blood like Kiss' lead guitarist

[Verse 6: Rah Digga]
Now who be yappin‘ ‘bout their shit so far
With them tight-ass dicks you’re tryna sell niggas (?)
Boys, I’m that bitch
Cocaine keep 6 digits
Doing remix for all them hoes with deep visions
Ya motherfuckin‘ rastas
Be filled with imposters
Singin‘ ‘nough fresh like Lil Kim singin‘ gospel
‘Cause we be the tightest in this whole rap place
You get your contract canceled like our boys in outer space
Come on

[Hook]
We be the hard act to follow (Follow!)
We the hard act to follow (follow)
We be the hard act to follow (Follow!)
We the hard act to follow (Follow!)
(Hard act to follow) Follow!
A hard act to follow (follow)
Outsidaz, come on!
