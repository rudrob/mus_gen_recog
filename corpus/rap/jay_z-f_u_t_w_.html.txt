                    Just let me great 2x
Don't be good my nigga
Be great
After that government cheese
We eating steak
After the projects
Now we on estates
I from the bottom
I know y'all can relate
F**k up the world
Let's f**k up this world
[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Me and destiny got a date
Martin had a dream
Hov gotta team
My chain already heavy
Don't let me get a ring
Parades down Flatbush
Confetti on my fur
Turn right on Red Hook
Niggas heavy on the curve
See most of my niggas died early twenties or late teens
I'm just trying to come from under the thumb of this regime
1% of a billion is more then niggas even seen
Still they wanna act like it's an everyday thing
Clean
[Hook]
F**k up the world
Let's f**k up this world
[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
High Yellow sky dweller and the rose gold
Legend of the summer in the Rose Bowl
Came thru Pasadena in the low low
Just to show respect to the chulos
Feel like a stranger in my own land
Got me feeling like Brody in Homeland
I just want my shot to show my genius
Standing on the top hold my penis
America tried to emasculate the greats
Murder Malcolm
Gave Cassius the shakes
Wait, tell them rumble young man rumble
Try to dim your lights tell you be humble
You know I'm gon shine like a trillion watts
You know I'm as trill as Michael Jackson socks
Send a light to Compton and the hundred blocks
Lil bastard boy
Basking on top
[Hook]
F**k up the world
Let's f**k up this world
[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Sipping D'USSE boy this ain't your daddy yak
He in a Cadillac
Me I'm in the Maybach
This ain't grey sweat suits and white tube socks
This is black leather pants and a pair of stance
Socks is my synopsis is clear
Got stripclubs feeling like Oxford
I swear, Teacher teacher
I trying to unteach ya
All the shit they taught y'all
They got you all in the bleachers
When you front row at the Knicks game
Those the Spike Lees
You front row every where you in the H.O.V.s
Jordan 1s and dungarees
And that's just the half of my warpath
Make a million another million let my niggas make a million
Till we all check a billion
Shit it's just the way I'm feeling
We have yet to see a ceiling
We just top what we top
Cause the bars don't struggle
And the struggle don't stop
[Hook]
F**k up the world
Let's f**k up this world
