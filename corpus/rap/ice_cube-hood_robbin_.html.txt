Man I aint gon be shit in the morning after drinking that uh...

(Ice Cube)
If I can sell you the american dream, I can sell you anything

[Ice Cube]
I got to get out, I'm getting put out of my house
I got to pack up, my refrigerator and couch
It's a set up, but the bank wants me out
Or the L.A.P.D. will smoke me out
This suggestible weight, it choke me out
They gave me a loan and I had no (cloud?)
They gave me a house, for me and my spouse
Call my momma and my aunt,
Y'all should re-finance,
I let them dance with the devil,
Make their own grave and I gave them the shovel
Fuck, my daddy built that house
And when he got drunk he almost killed that house
Is this the american dream, or the american scheme?
That got me walking in these american streets?
It's kinda sad when you have to get a hernia,
Cuz you help your grand mama move her furniture

if I can sell you the american dream, I can sell you anything,

Look at this maggot, with a stimulus package
I can give a fuck about
What the fuck you do when your paycheck is average?
Law abiding citizen turn into a savage,
Got to feed the children, got to feed the habit
Fell into a rabbit hole, chasing that rabbit
Now I'm in wonderland feeling like
I'm at your west coast branch,
Imma feel like superman,
Walk by the teller, better call the trooper, man
It's the revenge of the lambs:
"big bad wolf, we're sick of these scams"
Sick of these plans, sick of this dance
Walk in to his office to deny up my pants
You're not a man, you're a servant
Then I pray to God they

I never get the working
You know I herd they hood robbin', your money or your life and there ain't no stopping

I never get the working
You know I herd they hood robbin', your money or your life and there ain't no stopping

Ain't that a bitch,
When you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich

Ain't that a bitch,
When you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich

[Ice Cube]
Uh, drug dealer envy
Doctor feel good, give you what you need
In California, prescribe that plead
Turn your grand mama into a fiend
And see the sign
I know you bout to die, but let me see your I'd
I know you bout to lie, but can you pay this fee?
If you can't pay, then please have a seat
You can't see a doctor but you could see a priest
We can't save your life until you get some insurance
I hope you got endurance,
They got me on hold they influence
Nurse high as a kite,
In charge with my life,
And everything is lost,
Without a blue cross

You know I herd they hood robbin', your money or your life and there ain't no stopping

You know I herd they hood robbin', your money or your life and there ain't no stopping

Ain't that a bitch,
When you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich

Ain't that a bitch,
When you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich
