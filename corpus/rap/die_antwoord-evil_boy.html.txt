Evil boy
Why is your incanca so big?

All the better to love you with
No glove no love
If you don't believe me
Take your dirty hands off my umthondo wisizwe

Happy, happy, joy, joy
Crush, kill, destroy

Car-crash rap style
Ah man that's wild
Evil boy rap time
People gooi zap signs
Full fuckin flex fres
Mega-zef go

Everybody go ho like a Thundercat
I'm all up in the club in my underpants
No shirt on cause it's fokken hot
Let's go Diplo pump it up

Girls wanna say hello to me
From the Zef side to the fucking overseas
I'm looking at who's lookin' at me
Lookin' at you lookin' back who can that be?

When I'm all up this
Bitch you know who the fuck it is
Roll through the club like a tokoloshe 
Ninja's hung like a fuckin' horse
Yeah girl, I'm a freak of nature
Sign my name on your boob 
Fuck a piece of paper

If you feelin' me, cool
Not feelin' me? Fuck off
Wies jy? Fokkol, umnqundu wakho

Yolandi Visser so fancy like this badass beat
Rock the motherfuckin' microphone with no panties
I'm a bad ass chick yo my black magic
Speletjies make all the boys go
Damn that's sick

Lie down on the bed boy lemme light candles
Uh uh, don't touch, Yolandi just too hot to handle
Blind-fold you lock your hands up with the hand-cuffs
Even though you lying down, I can make you stand up

Spirits in the room tickle you like a sneaky prawn
Fuck a pen and pad, I write my rhymes with a Ouija board
Draw a pentagram on your chest wif my lipstick
Visions in the mirror heavy Zef futuristic

Lemme take your pants off
Let's see what you made of
Go through your pockets, no we not going to make love
Go through your wallet, whoa, look at all this paper
What a fuckin' sucker, see you later masturbator

I went from fokol to so fokken hot
Right now I'll put you in your place
Motherfucker skrik wakker
We coming through pumping you full of bass

Fok rustig eks apokaliptikal
Fucking you in the face

Zef cherries tjoon my
Spieg my fokken hol nat

Fuck everyone eyes on the prize
When I go for the jugular
Surprise me or fokof and die
When I remind you of how much you suck

Everyone's so fokken so-so
Yo we been sent to fuck you up
Zef techno mosh-pit gangsta nommer een kind

Everything you rap about comes true
If you got some freakin' balls
But mind your tongue
When you rhyme on the drum
Gaan vra vir Biggie Smalls

I gotta rock if you motherfucking like it or not
Yo, is you ready for this ho style take over?
Bow to the fokken master, my slang is banging
I'm freaking the fuck out of myself
Yo I'm my biggest fan

Cause buddy when you man down
No fokken hands out when you really need a hand
Machine gun rapper

Lekker budda-budda motherfucker
Yo I'm bigger than 
Koos kombuis se ma se fokken poes

Nana, nanana
You can't fuck wif this, ou 
Blah blah blah, whatever
Watch a million fuckin' kids go

Nana, nanana
Super fokken fresh flow 
Ninja, wanga and Yolandi Visser
Versus Diplo

Evil Boy, Evil Boy, Evil Boy loves you
