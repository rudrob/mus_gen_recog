                    Fuck em' all
Fuck em' all 
Fuck em' all

Verse 1: 2Pac 

Now I can make it happen 
My rappin' is similar to muthafuckers 
When they scrappin' 
Blast and watch em' back up 
Notorious biggie killer 
Affiliation with death row 
Niggaz get their caps pealed back 
Fool this the west coast 
Fuck a misdemeanor I'm raisin hell like felonies 
Mr. Makaveli straight outta jail to sellin' these 
Intoxicated we duplicated but never faded 
Now that we made it my adversaries is player hatin' 
Got a Mercedes for these tricks 
That thought I quit 
Then got a drop top jag for these bitches that's on my dick 
Go to a club in a pack 
I'm smokin' bud in the back 
I wait for niggaz to trip 
Cause bitch I love to scrap 
Now mama raised me as a thug nigga 
With love niggaz 
I'm a millionaire started as a drug dealer 
I went from rocks to zines 
Writing raps and movies 
I went from trustin'' these tricks now they all want to sue me 
So Fuck em' all 

Chorus x2

Now I've been called crazy
To fade me is not possible
I give a fuck
What you thought or who you brought with you
A Bad Boy killer
Biggie annihilator
They wonderin why he breathin but bitches die later

Verse 2: 2Pac

Is it, money or women to funny beginnings, tragic endings
I can make a million and STILL not get enough of spending
And since my life is based on sinning, I'm hell bound
Rather be buried than be worried, living held down
My game plan to be trained and, military
Mind of a Thug Lord, sittin in the cemetery
Caught, I've been lost since my adolescence, calling to Jesus
Balling as a youngster, Wondering if he sees us
Young black male, crack sales got me three strikes
Living in jail, this is hell, enemies die
Wonder when we all pass is anybody listening?
Got my, hands on my semi shotty, everybody's bitchin
Please God can you understand me, bless my family
Guide us all, before we fall into insanity
I make it a point, to make my beat bumpin warlike
Drop some shit, to have these stupid bitches jaws tight.

Chorus x2

Now I've been called crazy
To fade me is not possible
I give a fuck
What you thought or who you brought with you
A Bad Boy killer
Biggie annihilator
They wonderin why he breathin but bitches die later

Verse 3: Tupac

I got glad bags with enemies 
Cut up so they remember me 
Soaked up in Hennessey 
So they relatives know it's me 
You can bet your last dollar 
I'll dick em' and holla 
Ridin' these hoochies 
Like they some heavy ass Chevy impalas 
Jump up and get your ass shot up 
For the profit pick my glock up 
I'm bustin' in self defense ya see 
Poppin' nobody got em' 
Holla Outlaw riders 
Mash up on the gas pedal 
Vacate the scene 
Count the cash and stash the precious metal 
Here come the coppers 
The swat team and the helicopters 
Them crackers is crazy 
Why? Cause they'll never stop us 
I watch Arnold Swarchzenegger 
bust some body in the movie 
Now I want to do it too 
Ohh, niggaz is too through 
True to the game 
I claim Outlaw riders 
We give a fuck what they try...

Verse 4 (cameo): Young Noble]

Cause Young Noble behind it 
Can you picture me stickin' niggaz for they watch and chain 
Kick back lil nigga 
And watch the game 

Chorus x2

Now I've been called crazy
To fade me is not possible
I give a fuck
What you thought or who you brought with you
A Bad Boy killer
Biggie annihilator
They wonderin why he breathin but bitches die later
