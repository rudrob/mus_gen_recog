                    Jump out your car in the middle of the street
Open up the truck let the base beat
Go ahead, go ahead, 
You gotta walk up in the club bear-footed 
I like that booty you know where to put it
Go ahead, go ahead.

Now mamma you look so professional I'm followin' you sweatin' you
I can't believe I'm doing what I'm doing
What is wrong with my head go ahead
'Cause baby I like how you're working it
And watching you, you twarkin' it
I'm trying get you out of this club and get you off in my bed
Ohh, go ahead, yeah.

[Chorus:]
Now let me see the booty work, booty work, 
Booty work, boo booty work, 
Booty work, booty work, boo boo boo booty work, 
Go ahead, go ahead, 
Now let me see the booty work, booty work, 
Booty work, boo booty work.
Left cheek, right cheek, left cheek, right cheek.

Black car, black rims, black shirt, black timbs
Leh go, leh go, come on baby keep on doin what you doin
Leh go, leh go, come on baby keep on doin what you doin

Holy moly, look at her, she got the boots with the fur
Let go, let go, come on baby keep on doin what you doin
Let go, let go, come on baby keep on doin what you doin
And mama I can see that thong on you the Dj play this song for you
I'm tryin to drive my stick shift all over ya curves
Say word, if you keep playin with my fitted we're gonna get it, get it, get it
Girl I represent the nappy boy clique so I know that you heard
Say word... 

[Chorus:]
Now let me see the booty work, booty work, 
Booty work, boo booty work, 
Booty work, booty work, boo boo boo booty work, 
Go ahead, go ahead, 
Now let me see the booty work, booty work, 
Booty work, boo booty work.
Left cheek, right cheek, left cheek, right cheek.
... 

Girl it must be a crime to be as fine as you aha
You know exactly what I'm tryin to do
You see me, I'm tryin to keep it jumpin'
Girl I got a chevy with hydraulics and you remindin' me of it
Up and down, up and down, girl you know what's happenin'
Round of applause, keep that booty clappin'
Them other girls lackin' what you packin'
And you got them embarrassed by what you got from your parents
I'm tryin to see them shorts, see them shorts spread apart 
I aint coming up short, up short Kevin Hart, Kevin Hart

Come on baby keep on doing what you're doing, 
Come on baby keep on doing what you're doing, 
Move your feet, cut a rug, put your hands up
If you're the baddest in the club.

Take off, come on baby keep on doing what you're doing, 
Girl I'm tryin get you next to me
But first you gotta let me see that booty work
Booty work, boo booty work, 
Booty work, booty work, boo boo boo booty work, 
Go ahead, go ahead, 
Now let me see the booty work, booty work, 
Boo, Boo Boo boo booty work.
Left cheek, right cheek, left cheek, right cheek.
... boom, boom, boom.

[Chorus:]
Now let me see the booty work, booty work, 
Booty work, boo booty work, 
Booty work, booty work, boo boo boo booty work, 
Go ahead, go ahead, 
Now let me see the booty work, booty work, 
Booty work, boo booty work.
Left cheek, right cheek, left cheek, right cheek.
