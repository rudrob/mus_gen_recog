[Young Joc:]

[T-Pain:]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohhhh, ohhh, ohhh, yea
Snap ya fingers, do ya step, you can do it all by yourself

[Verse 1 - T-Pain:]
Baby girl
What's your name?
Let me talk to you
Let me Buy You A Drank
I'm T-Pain, you know me
Konvict Music, Nappy Boy, ohh wee
I know the club close at 3
What's the chances of you rollin' wit' me?
Back to the crib
Show you how I live
Let's get drunk, forget what we did

[Chorus - T-Pain:]
I'ma Buy You A Drank
then I'ma take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty, what you think 'bout that?
Find me in the grey Cadillac
We in the bed like
"Ooh Ooh Ohh, Ooh Ooh"
We in the bed like
"Ooh Ooh Ooh, Ooh Ooh"

[Verse 2 - T-Pain:]
Talk to me, I talk back
Let's talk money, I talk that
Crunk juice bombs
Oakley shades
Shawty got class
Oh, behave
Let's get gone
Walk it out (now walk it out)
Just like that
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
We goin' have fun
You goin' see
On that patron
You should get like me

[Chorus]
I'ma Buy You A Drank
then I'ma take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty, what you think 'bout that?
Find me in the grey Cadillac
We in the bed like
"Ooh Ooh Ohh, Ooh Ooh"
We in the bed like
"Ooh Ooh Ooh, Ooh Ooh"


[Verse 3 - Young Joc:]
Won't You Meet Me At The Bar?
Respect big pimpin'
Tell me how you feel
Mama tell me what you sippin'
A certified dime piece
Deserve Louy 1-3
$150 a shot
3 for you and 3 for me
I'm checkin' yo body language
I love the conversation
And when you lick your lips
I get a tinglin' sensation
Now we're both 'bout tipsy
You say you "in the mood"
All I need is 'bout an hour
Better yet, maybe two
Let me take you where I live
Ferrari switch gears
When I whisper in ya ear
Ya legs hit the chandelier
Passion fruit and sex
All in the atmosphere
I'ma let T-Pain sing it
So he can make it clear

[Chorus]
I'ma Buy You A Drank
then I'ma take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty, what you think 'bout that?
Find me in the grey Cadillac
We in the bed like
"Ooh Ooh Ohh, Ooh Ooh"
We in the bed like
"Ooh Ooh Ooh, Ooh Ooh"


[Verse 4 - T-Pain & Yung Joc:]
Let's get gone
Walk it out
(Now walk it out, think about it,ya right there thats what im talkin bout
Now rock, rock, rock, rock
You can do it all by yourself

Let's get gone
Walk it out
(Now walk it out, think about it, ohhhhhhh snap!)
Now rock, rock, rock, rock
You can do it all by yourself


[Chorus]
I'ma Buy You A Drank
then I'ma take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty, what you think 'bout that?
Find me in the grey Cadillac
We in the bed like
"Ooh Ooh Ohh, Ooh Ooh"
We in the bed like
"Ooh Ooh Ooh, Ooh Ooh"
