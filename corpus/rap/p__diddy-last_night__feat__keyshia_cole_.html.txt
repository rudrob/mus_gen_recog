                    [Diddy] 
Last Night 
(Last Night) 
I Couldn't Even Get An Answer 
(Answer, Answer, Answer) 
I Tried To Call 
(I Tried To Call) 
But My Pride Wouldn't Let Me Dial 
(Dial, Dial, Dial) 
And I'm Sitting Here 
(Sitting Here) 
With This Blank Expression 
(Expression, Expression, Expression) 
And The Way I Feel (Way I Feel) 
I Wanna Curl Up Like A Child (Child, Child) 

I Know U Can Hear Me 
I Know U Can Feel Me 
I Can't Live Without You 
God Please Make Me Better 
I Wish I Wasn’t The Way I Am

[Keyshia Cole] 
If I Told You Once, 
I Told You Twice 
You Can See It in My Eyes 
I'm All Cried Out 
With Nothing To Say 
You 're Everything I Wanted It To Be 
If You Could Only See 
Your Heart Belongs To Me 
I Love You So Much 
I'm Hurting For Your Touch 
Come And Set Me Free 
Forever Yours I'll Be 
Baby Won't You Come 
And Take This Pain Away

[chorus] 
Last Night (Last Night) 
I Couldn't Even Get An Answer (Answer) 
( You Said You Couldn't Get An Answer Baby ) 
I Tried To Call (I Tried To Call) 
But My Pride Wouldn't Let Me Dial (Dial) 
( But That Should Never Stopped You ) 
And I'm Sitting Here (Sitting Here) 
( Sitting There ) 
With This Blank Expression (Expression) 
( I'll Be With Ya My Baby ) 
And The Way I Feel 
( Way I Feel ) 
I Wanna Curl Up Like A Child (Child) 
( Ooh Baby...Oh No )

[Keyshia Cole] 
I Need You 
And You Need Me 
This Is So Plain To See 
And I Would Never Let You Go 
And I Will Always Love You So...I Will 
If You Could Only See 
Your Heart Belongs To Me 
I Love You So Much 
I'm Hurting For Your Touch 
Come And Set Me Free 
Forever Yours I'll Be 
Baby Won't You Come 
And Take This Pain Away

[chorus] 
Last Night (Last Night) 
( ...Yeah... ) 
I Couldn't Even Get An Answer (Answer) 
( Couldn't Even Answer Baby...Oh ) 
I Tried To Call (Tried To Call) 
( Call Me Baby ) 
But My Pride Wouldn’t Let Me Dial (Dial) 
( Why Couldn't You Just Dial Me Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby Baby Baby ) 
And I’m Sitting Here (Sitting Here) 
With This Blank Expression (Expression) 
( Don't Say A Thing...No ) 
And The Way I Feel 
( Alright ) 
I Wanna Curl Up Like A Child (Child) 
( I'm Soo Alone, I'm Soo Lonely Baby...Oh )

[Diddy] 
Tell Me What.. 
What the Words To Say 
To Make You Come back 
And Break Me Like That 
And If It Matters 
What Matters If It Don't 
We Can Go Never Ever Alone 
Don't Wanna Wait Til You Go 
Tonight When (??????) 
Just Don't Leave Me

[chorus] 
Last Night (Last Night) 
( ...Hey...Yeah... ) 
I Couldn't Even Get An Answer (Answer) 
( I Couldn't Baby Baby...Yeah, Oh ) 
I Tried To Call (I Tried To Call) 
( Call Me Baby ) 
But My Pride Wouldn’t Let Me Dial 
( Why Couldn't You Just Dial Me Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby ) 
And Im Sitting Here (Sitting Here) 
With This Blank Expression (Expression) 
( Don't Say A Thing...No ) 
And The Way I Feel 
( Alright ) 
I Wanna Curl Up Like A Child 
( I'm Soo Alone, I'm Soo Lonely Baby...Oh )

[Keyshia Cole] 
Why Don't You Pick Up The Phone 
And Dial Up My Number 
And Call Me My Baby 
I'm Waiting On You 
Why Don't You Pick Up The Phone 
And Dial Up My Number 
Just Call Me Up Baby 
I'm Waiting On You
