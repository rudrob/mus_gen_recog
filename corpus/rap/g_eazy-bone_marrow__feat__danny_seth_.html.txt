                    Yeah
The British are here
The Bay is here, you know?


Pull up in that Bruce Wayne
Bruce Wayne, that's my new thing
Black on black on black on black down to the shoe string
Yo bitch call me daddy, daddy, that's my new name
Acid rafter, all aboard like a choo-train
You and I are not the same
Difference not a watch and chain
Difference is my DNA, so what you saying?
Leather pants and velvet shirts and VMA
I’m built for fame
Speeding fast so if I see you in my way
I’ll switch my lane, vroom
Realest in the room
Been real since the womb
Till I’m in the tomb
If I take your bitch, then that pussy doomed
Eat it like a spoon
Your bitch coming soon
Like a motion picture
Listen if I'm smoking whicha
Then we getting fucked up all night
Tell me when that dope has hit you, yeah
Party and you see how late it is
You gon' find out my definition of what faded is
Young Gerald

Bad to the bone, yeah, the bone marrow
Bitch I’m bad to the bone, yeah, the bone marrow
All I give a fuck about is that dinero
They say "You a fool boy, what’s wrong with Gerald?"


Five years too deep
Two birds, one seat
Two girls, one butt
This dick ain’t free
In the hills, so steep
Need the mills like a mink
And I come out on top, your career crappy
In her mouth like a cheap
Skipped the bitch like a beat
Smoke cocaine, drink, then repeat
I ain’t slept about like a week
See this lifestyle ain’t cheap
But when I pop up it’s free
Tell all of my brothers we all in the section
But trust me this section isn't on me
See the flower, I done did it
Popping off like prescription
Killed the beat, she the witness
Call me jack how I rip this
Poker cards how I flip this
Your main hoe is my fitness
I like her stick-thin and titless
I pray I make right decisions
‘Cause if I left they’d be tripping
Without a suit I make business
Forced out to cash lyrics
Fuck the fame, man, I lived it
I’m blowing up like a chimney
Skinny white boy from Britain
I rack my M’s ‘til I’m riddance


I'm bad to the bone, yeah, the bone marrow
I’m bad to the bone, yeah, the bone marrow
All I wanna do is fuck and take a xanny
They say "You a fool man, what’s wrong with Danny?"

[Verse 3: G-Eazy + Danny Seth]
See I'm a simple person, I like to drink my Bourbon
The most interesting man alive but I'm a different version
You see, I been determined, it's a wrap like a turban
I'm getting to the money, you're washed up like dish detergent
Pulled up with her skirt off, ugh leave here with her clothes off
On shit like I'm Murdock, I'm the one that you heard of
Talk shit, get burned off, being broke is a turn off
Keep spitting fire, the temp is high like I got my shirt off
The cap is off of these bottles, Di Caprio to these models
The phone's out when we're partying
I've had enough of these problems
The British come and I wander
I fuck tens, I bought 'em
Cocaine and these models
And that's the first one brother
Yeah, okay, every day my stock inclines
I don't see no stopping signs
Some model bitches chopping lines
Chopping lines, this is getting common, it's a hobby, I'm...
I'm partying like every night, do this shit until we die


Bad to the bone, yeah, the bone marrow
Bitch I’m bad to the bone, yeah, the bone marrow
All I give a fuck about is that dinero
They say "You a fool boy, what’s wrong with Gerald?"
