High 'Til I Die
Loced 'Til they smoke me
The Shit don't stop
Til my casket drop
I'm High 'Til I Die
Loced 'Til they smoke me
The Shit don't stop
Til my casket drop
I'm High 'Til I Die
Loced 'Til they smoke me
Shit don't stop
The shit don't stop

[Verse 1]
Game rules, ain't got time for fools
Money on my mind, so my nine rules
Time to make wieght, niggas gettin' crazy paid
Hate bitches for the games they play
So nigga, pull quick, but better be quicker
Than the next mutha fucka on the trigger
Cause I'm static, startin' to be a fuckin' habit
Gotta keep my automatic, or get my ass kicked
When I'm travelin', it's kind of puffin' I drive a bucket
Little Thug Life nigga screaming, "Fuck it"
I love to throw my middle finger to the police
And no bucks, no justice, no peace
I'm smoking blunts 'til I pass out
Yeah, nigga, getting assed out
Rollin' and my niggas, glass out
Drving fast, talking to bitches, whipping cash out
I'm with my niggas, so fuck the suckas, I'm bucking brothas
Smoking chronic muthafuckas causing ruckus
It's the last of the drank, pull over
Can't hear a damn thing sober

[Hook]

Lord help me save me
Mama keep praying for a young motherfucka
Trying to duck an early grave
In the city where you can't tell the fakes from the snakes
Enemies from phonies, friends from your homies
Around the corner there's another nigga waiting to jack
He don't know I got a Glock 'til his ass get shot
Like a mutha fuckin' Thug disease
Claiming Peace, like they motherfuckin' trustin' me
Hey, what's up with bitches trying to screw me
Do me cause I did a movie
Throw the pussy to me
But before they never knew me
Rather die then let yah
Play me for like a Busta
And with my Glock
I'm a plotin' ass rotten mutha fucka
Hey don't let that movie fool yah, let me school yah
Screaming Thug Life nigga when I do yah
It's the last of the drank, pull over
Can't hear a damn thang sober

[Hook]
