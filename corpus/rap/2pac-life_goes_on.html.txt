                    Chorus: 
How many brothas spell victim to tha streetz 
Rest in peace young nigga, there's a Heaven for a 'G' 
be a lie, If I told ya that I never thought of death 
my niggas, we tha last ones left 
but life goes on..... 
(repeat) 


As I bail through tha empty halls 
breath stinkin' 
in my draws 
ring, ring, ring 
quiet y'all 
incoming call 
plus this my homie from high school 
he's getting bye 
It's time to bury another brotha nobody cry 
life as a baller 
alchol and booty calls 
we usta do them as adolecents 
do you recall? 
raised as G's 
loc'ed out and blazed the weed 
get on tha roof 
let's get smoked out 
and blaze with me 
2 in tha morning 
and we still high *ssed out 
screamin' 'thug till I die' 
before I passed out 
but now that your gone 
i'm in tha zone 
thinkin' 
'I don't wanna die all alone' 
but now ya gone 
and all I got left are stinkin' memories 
I love them niggas to death 
i'm drinkin' Hennessy 
while tryin' ta make it last 
I drank a 5th for that *ss 
when you passed.... 
cause life goes on 


(Chorus) 


Yeah nigga 
I got tha word as hell 
ya blew trial and tha judge gave you 
25 with an L 
time to prepare to do fed time 
won't see parole 
imagine life as a convict 
that's getten' old 
plus with tha drama 
we're lookin out for your babies mama 
taken risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from gettin on her... 
life in tha hood... 
is all good for nobody 
remember gamin' on dumb hoties at chill parties 
Me and you 
No true a two 
while scheming on hits 
and gettin tricks 
that maybe we can slide into 
but now you burried 
rest nigga 
cause I ain't worried 
eyes bluried 
sayin' goodbye at the cemetary 
tho' memories fade 
I got your name tated on my arm 
so we both ball till' my dying days 
before I say goodbye 
Kato, we're meant to rest in peace 
Thug till I die 


(Chorus) 


Bury me smilin' 

with G's in my pocket 
have a party at my funeral 
let every rapper rock it 
let tha hoes that I usta know 
from way before 
kiss me from my head to my toe 
give me a paper and a pen 
so I can write about my life of sin 
a couple bottles of Gin 
incase I don't get in 
tell all my people i'm a Ridah 
nobody cries when we die 
we outlaws 
let me ride 
until I get free 
I live my life in tha fast lane 
got police chasen me 
to my niggas from old blocks 
from old crews 
niggas that guided me through 
back in tha old school 
pour out some liquor 
have a toast for tha homies 
see we both gotta die 
but ya chose to go before me 
and brothas miss ya while your gone 
you left your nigga on his own 
how long we mourn 
life goes on... 


(Chorus) 


Life goes on homie 
gone on, cause they passed away 
Niggas doin' life 
Niggas doin' 50 and 60 years and shit 
I feel ya nigga, trust me 
I feel ya 
You know what I mean 
last year 
we poured out liquor for ya 
this year nigga, life goes on 
we're gonna clock now 
get money 
evade bitches 
evade tricks 
give players plenty space 
and basicaly just represent for you baby 
next time you see your niggas 
your gonna be on top nigga 
their gonna be like, 
'Goddamn, them niggas came up' 
that's right baby 
life goes on.... 
and we up out this b*tch 
hey Kato, Mental 
y'all niggas make sure it's popin' when we get up there 
don't front

                    Â
