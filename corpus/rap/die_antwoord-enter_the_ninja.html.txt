                    Aai, aai, ai
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai

Aai, aai, ai
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection

I’m a ninja
Yo, my life is like a videogame
I maintain when I’m in the 
Zone
One player one life on the mic limited time

Yo ninja, go
No fuckin around I’m cutting down
Anyone in my path
Trying fuck up my game 
With razor sharp
Lyrical throwin' stars

Jirre my flow's hot
Hostile, wild out of control
Ninja skop befoket rof 
Taal
Rough rhymes tough times

Met fokkol kos
Skraal
Till I hit triple seven at the ATM
Straight famine or feast
When you living on the razor edge
Stay sharp sharp

Rolling wih the SOS
High energy
Never seen zef so fresh
Uh, when we mic check
Hi-tek flow’s flex
Yo we optimistik
Not fuckin' depressed
We not like the rest

My style is UFO
Totally unknown
You can’t fuck with my new zef flow
I’m hard to miss
You can’t do this, you can’t do that

Yo fuckin who said so?
I do what I like
Too hot to handle, too cold to hold
You can’t fuck with the chosen one
I, I, I want the knife
I’m a Ninja

Aai, aai, ai
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai

Aai, aai, ai
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection

Aai, aai, ai
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai

Aai, aai, ai
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection

Ninja is poes cool
But don’t fuck with my game boy
Or I’ll poes you
Life is tough
When I get stuck
When my time is up

I push through
Till I break, break, break 
On through to the other side
Fantastically poor with faces like a stalker

Ninja is hardcore
Been cut so deep feel no pain
Its not sore
Don’t ask for kak or
You’ll get what you ask for

I’m like a wild animal in the corner
Waiting for the break of dawn
Trying to get through the night
Just a man with a will to survive

My blade swing free
Decapitate a hater with amazing ease
This is not a game boy
Don’t play with me
I work my mic-saber like a wild fucking savage
From the dark side danger

Yin to the yang
Totally Hi-Tek Ninja's
Motherfucking big in Japan
I've seen the future but I never got nothing in my hand
Except a microphone, big dreams and a plan
Fly-talking, sky-walking
Like a Ninja

Aai, aai, ai
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai

Aai, aai, ai
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection

Aai, aai, ai
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai

Aai, aai, ai
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection

Fuck
This is luck
The coolest song I ever heard in my whole life
Fuck all of you who said I wouldn’t make it

They said I was a loser
They said I was a no one
They said I was a fuckin' psycho

But look at me now
All up on the interweb
Worldwide
2009
Futuristic
Enter the Ninja

I am your butterfly

Need your protection

Yo I'm a Ninja

I need your protection
Need your protection
