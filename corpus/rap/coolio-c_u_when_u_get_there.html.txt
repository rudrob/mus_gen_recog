                    Now I've seen places and faces 
And things you ain't never thought about thinking 
If you ain't peek then you must be drinking and smokin 
Pretending not to loc'in but you're broken, let me get you open 
Now little Timmy got his diploma and little Jimmy got life 
And Tamikra around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe 
The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money 
And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny 
But who's the dummy, cause, now you done lost the hustler 
A down-ass brother got replaced by a buster 
And though I got love for ya, I know I can't trust ya 
Cause my crew is rollin home and your crew is rollin dusta 
And just because of that you act like you don't like the brother no more 
Uh, I guess that's just the way it goes 
I ain't tryin to preach, I believe I can reach 
But your mind ain't prepared, I'll see you when you get there 

Chorus: 

I'll see you when you get there 
When you ever get there 
See you when you get there 
I'll see you when you get there 
If you ever get there 
See you when you get there 

Verse Two: Lek Ratt (40 Thevz) 

More temptation and faith, I guess we livin for the day 
I seen a man get swept off his feet, by a bullet and an AK 
The situation so twisted everybody gettin lifted 
I'm just tryin to take care of my kids and handle my business 
Cause it way too serious so you gotta pay close attention 
So you don't get caught sittin' when they come and do all the gettin 
Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big horse 
Someone's gotta run a little faster cause we gotta lay the strugle 
I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender 
And if everybody's a sinner then everybody could be a winner 
No matter you rag collar deep down we all brothers 
And regardless of the time somebody out there still love us 
I'm a scuff and struggle and y'all I'm breathless and weak 
I just strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak 
Always keep reaching sure to grab on to something 
I'll be there when you get there when you wit the sound bumpin 

Chorus 

Verse Three: PS (40 Thevz) 

You need to loosen up and live a little 
And if you got kids let them know how you feelin 
For your own sake give a little 
Oh, you don't want to hear that, you busy tryina stack 
and keep them from the Jones's is taking advantage of your own 
The realest homies that you've been knowing for the longest 
But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone 
Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us 
We prefer to keep our eyes shut to describe when 
It's something wrong and we desire 
so hold your head up high if your poor and righteous 
I know time seems right, and the problems seem endless 
But at the times of despair we gotta put ourselves together 
And if you feel you're out of the game then you need to get back in it 
Cause nothing worse than a quitter 
you gotta face responsibility one day, my brother 
so gather up your pitty and turn it to ambition 
and put your vehicle and drive and stop by my side 

Chorus 

Outro: Coolio 

As we walk down the road of our destiny 
And the time comes to choose which it gonna be 
The wide and crooked, on a straight barrel 
We got one push to give and one life to live 
Stand up for something or lie down in your game 
Listen to the song that we sing 
It's up to you to make it big 
I guess I'll see you when you see me 

Chorus -- fade out
