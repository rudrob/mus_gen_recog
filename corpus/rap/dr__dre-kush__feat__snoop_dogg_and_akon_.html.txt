Roll up, wait a minute
Let me put some kush up in it
Roll up, wait a minute
Let me put some kush up in it
Roll up, wait a minute
Let me put some kush up in it
Roll up, wait a minute
Let me put some kush up in it

[Dr Dre]
Now this that puff puff pass shit
that Cheech and Chong glass shit
blunts to the head, kush spillin’ no matters
speed boat traffic, bitches automatic
cross that line, fick around and get yo ass kicked
we roll shit that burn slow as f-cking malasis
probably won’t pass it, smoke it till the last hit
down to the ashes, Mary J. a bad b-tch
Andre 3001 another classic
go ahead ask him bitches, bout “how I be smokin’ out”
party all night, yea its goin’ down
order rounds, we smokin’ quarter pounds of that good stuff
O yea we smokin’ all night
yea puff puff pass that shit right here
nigga, better than my last batch, caramel complexion and her ass black
inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,

[Akon]
I know you tryna get high,
Type of shit that have ya leaning sideways,
make her work for this suicide,
holla at me cuz I got it all day,
no need to fly to Jamaica,
quarter ganja, we can get the same thing,
you want that bom bom biggy, holla at my niggi right here in L.A.
inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale

[Hook]
hold up, wait a minute,
let me put some bits up in it,
hold up, wait a minute,
let me put some bits up in it.

[Snoop Dogg]
Huh... Still I am!
Tighter than the pants on Will.I.Am!
Backthrow, back still, I have a pound in my backpack
Next to where the swishas at, smokin’ presidential
Got some bubba, I give me that
Need it for my cataracts
Four hoes, and I’m the pimp, in my Cadillac
You can tell them Cali back
Matter fact, they a know, this aint Dro
Yea! Get a whiff of that!
Mo it aint no seeds in my sack
You aint never gottta ask dawg
What he smokin’ on?
Shit kush till my mind gone
What you think Im on
Eyes low, Im blown
High as a muthafucka, aint no question bout it
Niggas say smoke me out, yea I really doubt it
Im Bob Marley reincarnated, so faded
So If you want it
You know yo nigga homie,
You can put it in a zag or a blunt and get blunted

inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale

[Akon]
I know you tryna get high
Type of shit that have ya leaning sideways
make her work for this suicide
holla at me cuz I got it all day
no need to fly to Jamaica
quarter ganja, we can get the same thing
you want that bom bom biggy, holla at my niggi right here in LA
inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale

[Hook]
we get that kush, we blow on the best smoke
inhale slow, no choke
make yo ass choke
hold up wait a minute
you can go put it back
cuz what you got in yo sack boy, it aint that
aint that Kush, we blow on the best smoke
inhale slow, no choke
make yo ass choke

inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale
