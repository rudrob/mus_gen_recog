                    [Chester Bennington] 
Together we made it 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall 

[Busta Rhymes:] 
See it niggas i survived the worst but my life is glorious 
But I know that I live to be hurdled and i'm so victorious 
Take a look I'm a symbol of greatness now call it Morpheus 
As force accumalted the wind and but a believe I'm so notorious 
Didn't know I've been buying my bread even though we rapping now (yes) 
And now when you look on my trip and you a nigga higher level tramping now 
And you see that everyone on my middle struggers and 
For your ass is never been an option 
A nigga paper long like we was on the trap and the hood choppin 
Get it! 

[Chorus: Chester Bennington] (Busta Rhymes) *Mike Shinoda* 
Together we made it (you see we did it niggas) 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall (c'mon) 
Forever we waited (haha!) 
And they told us we were never going to get it 
but we took it on the road (through the riches) 
on the road (through the ghetto) 
on the roooooad (and the projects to this bangin instrumental) 
on the road (ride with me) *yeah, yeah* 
on the road (you come and get it) *yeah, yeah* 
on the roooooooad *yeah, yeah, yeah, yo!* 

[Mike Shinoda:] 
When it all got started we was steadily just getting rejected 
And it seemed like nothing we could do would ever get us respected 
And thus we were stressed and the worst they probably said was we're pathetic 
Had all the pieces to that puzzle but just no way to connect it 
And I was fighting through every ryhme, tighting up every line 
Never resting the question and I was out of my mind 
And finally came time to do it or let it die 
So put the chips on the table and told me to let it ride 
Sing it! 

[Chorus: Chester Bennington] (Busta Rhymes) 
Together we made it (you see we did it niggas) 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall (c'mon) 
Forever we waited (haha!) 
And they told us we were never going to get it 
but we took it on the road (through the riches) 
on the road (through the ghetto) 
on the roooooad (and the projects to this bangin instrumental) 
on the road (ride with me) 
on the road (you come and get it) 
on the roooooooad 

[Busta Rhymes:] 
Look in case you misunderstanded exactly what I'm building 
Shit that I could live for my children (children) children (children) 
Now I only wake up I smile to see how far I've come 
Fighting for sales on a strip to get hustle from 
From nights in jail on a bench using my muscles son 
To count money like Dre, Jimmy and Russell Ones 
But now I live when I dream you see me finally getting it 
Let's make a toast to the hustle regardless how we get it 
Singing 

[Chorus: Chester Bennington] (Busta Rhymes) 
Together we made it (you see we did it niggas) 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall (c'mon) 
Forever we waited (haha!) 
And they told us we were never going to get it 
but we took it on the road (through the riches) 
on the road (through the ghetto) 
on the roooooad (and the projects to this bangin instrumental) 
on the road (ride with me) 
on the road (you come and get it) 
on the roooooooad
