I got my eyes on you,
you’re everything that I see.
I want your high love and emotion endlessly.
I can't get over you,
you left your mark on me.
I want your high love and emotion endlessly.
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it,
you act so different around me.
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be.

Hook:
So just hold on, we're going home.
Just hold on, we're going home.
It's hard to do these things alone.
Just hold on, we're going home, yeah!
