                    Don’t you open up that window
Don’t you let out that antidote
Poppin’ pills is all we know
In the hills is all we know Hollywood
Don’t go through the front door
Through the back
It’s lowkey at the night show
So don’t you open up that window
Don’t you let out that antidote


Party on a Sunday That was fun
Do it all again on Monday one more time
Spent a check on a weekend Oh my God
I might do it all again That’s boss s**t
I just hit a three peat
F**ked three hoes I met this week Robert Horry
I don’t do no old hoes Oh, no, no
My ni**a, that’s a no, no Straight up
She just want the coco Cocaina
I just want diñero
Who that at the front door?
If it’s the feds, oh, no, no, no

Don’t you open up that window
Don’t you let out that antidote
Poppin’ pills is all we know
In the hills is all we know Hollywood
Don’t go through the front door
Through the back
It’s lowkey at the night show
So don’t open up that window
Don’t you let out that antidote


Anything can happen at the night show
Everything can happen at the night show
At the night show
Anything can happen at the night show
At the night show
Your bitch not at home, she at the night show
F**king right, ho
Had to catch a flight for the night show
Let’s get piped though
Bottles got us right though, we ain’t sipping light though
I ain’t got no type though
Only got one night though, we can do it twice though
It’s lit at the night show


At the night show
At the night show
At the night show
At the night show
At the night show
At the night show
Anything can happen at the night show


Stacking up day to day
Young ni**a you know you gotta go get it, go get it, my ni**a
They hating, they stinking, they waiting
Don’t be mistaken, we dying, they staying
Lord I’m on fire they think that I’m satan
Calling me crazy on different occasions
Kicking the cameraman off of my stages
Cause I don’t like how he snapping my angles
I’m overboard and I’m over impatient
Over my ni**as and these kids my ages
Dealing with Mo shit that’s more complicated
Like these two bi**hes that might be related
H-Town, you got one
And you Bun B like a number one
It’s late night, got a late show
If you wanna roll, I got a place where
