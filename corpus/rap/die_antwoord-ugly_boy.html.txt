Ugly on the skin
But you're lovely from within
An angel kiss from me to you
Always there for me when I'm feelin' blue
You say you'll stick with me and I know you well
I just get so emotional
When I'm down and feeling weak
With tears streaming down my cheeks
You say the sweetest things
Like material stuff don't mean a thing
But you take care of me to keep you safe
You so freaky babe

[NINJA]

Anything you need (You got it)
Anything at all (You got it)
Just keep it real with me (You got it)
