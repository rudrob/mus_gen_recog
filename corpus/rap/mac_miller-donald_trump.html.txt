                    [Mac Miller]
Ay yo, the flyest mutha-fcka up in the room
Yeah, you know it’s me
Bitches hating on him, cause he started out here locally
Hopefully, I’ll be at the top soon
For now, I’m at my house on the couch, watching cartoons
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a f-ck about a budget when you always be the subject of discussion
But it’s nothing when you stop and just say f-ck it
Cause you walking out in public and hear ‘em talkin’ rubbish
I just wanna ride, ride through the city in a Cutlass
Find a big butt bitch, somewhere get my nuts kissed
Thats the way it goes when you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick that used to brush me off in high school
Take over the world when I’m on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money, aint that some shit
Take over the world when I’m on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money, aint that some shit

[Ref]
We gonna take over the World while these haters gettin’ mad
That’s why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have and they in awe
We gon win, you can take the lose or draw
What I’m in, got these hoes that used to play me and they broads
We gonna take over the World while these haters gettin’ mad
Take over the World, watch these haters get mad
That’s why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
Hop into to the car then we take ‘em to the pad
It’s a wrap

[Mac Miller - Verse 2]
And muthaf-ckas think they know me but they never met the kids
Style come with excellence and money make benevolence
Irrelevant for the f-ckers who never been intelligent
I kill my Henny, break the bottle for the hell of it
Tell a bitch, she better bring her friend
And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah the party never ran, this life is what I recommend
And if you got a hoe it for me, then she better be a 10
I aint picky but these girls be acting tricky
When the situation’s sticky and the liquor got ‘em silly
But I take over the World when I’m on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money, aint that some shit

[Ref]
We gonna take over the World while these haters gettin’ mad
That’s why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have and they in awe
We gon win, you can take the lose or draw
What I’m in, got these hoes that used to play me and they broads
We gonna take over the World while these haters gettin’ mad
Take over the World, watch these haters get mad
That’s why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
Hop into to the car then we take ‘em to the pad
It’s a wrap
