                    I'm with a hundred and one niggas, we Dalmatian doggy deep
And fly with the tongue so if u feelin froggy leap
Kermit you better think before you ribbit
Don't be murdered over your song before ad-lib it
I pop up like Xzibit
But givin' I'm at your crib it's
Not to put no fuckin fish tanks in your Civics
Fuck getting your ride pimped
You'll get hog-tied whipped
Have you in da trunk curled up like fried shimp
It's been a good year maybe I should ride a blimp
Cause your boy jus stay above the game
They tryna tag em, spray a brotha frame
But your shots can't reach me I'm way above your aim
Go 'head nigga, say another name
Take this family for a joke play them Wayan Brothers games
And I'm a get you sucka I be scheming with dis keenin
Aimin with dis Damon

My lil man is on ya Marlon and Shawn ya
Lay da beef on dis noodle
Make some noodle lasagna
40 cal fetticine tres pound pasta
You reach for dis medalion you must like Italian, nigga
You only see me pushin if the drivers tired
I work da S6 ever since the 5 retired
The drop top, dey say it's Ocean Drive inspired
So you could call a cab once your bitch fall for Fab

Or... I let that semi twirl ya

Cause one shot outta the clip will Jberi curl you
Leave you sloppy like seconds
Obey me like peasants
Or get opened up like presents
