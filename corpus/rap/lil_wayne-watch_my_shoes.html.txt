No ceilings muthaf-cker good morning,
d-ck in your mouth while you yawning,
Im goin in, Gudda why they started me,
Marley why they started me,
I’ll bring it to your front door like you ordered me,
back in this b-tch but a lot more rich,
on my poppa bear sh-t, need hot porridge,
gotta a lot more sh-t than you could ever fathom,
a big head n-gga couldn’t even imagine,
the sh-t I do, most doer’s never done,
I’ma f-ck this beat, your b-tch who you better come,
better run this sh-t, i dont run from sh-t,
I still beat your ass like a f-cking drumstick,
Weezy f-cking baby baby make the ladies come quick,
the money can’t fit in my pockets but I bet that gun fit,
and I’m so unfit cos all I eat is rappers,
and these rappers aint sh-t I like my fast food faster,
syrup got me slow like a turtle round this hoe,
and Im flyer than the highest flying bird around this hoe,
whats the word around this hoe, you get served around this hoe,
yeah you get served like a f-cking H’ordeurve around this hoe,
I don’t splurge around no hoe, no I don’t shine in front no b-tch,
cos after she get off my d-ck I be like find the front door b-tch,
i dont know why the f-ck your b-tch keep coming by and I f-ck your b-tch 100 times what the f-ck your b-tch got on her mind, my f-cking d-ck,
I call her dick head, spicy like a big red, strike you like a bic head
your flow sick, my sh-t dead, sillier than vic said, soulja boy and arab,
you should see my eleven year old daughter do they dance,
I call it the nay nay dance proud to be nay nay’s dad,
gun on the waistline, leave you in the wasteland,
we are not the same, I am a martian, this is space jam,
no ceilings R-I-P Amen, muthf-cking cave man
beating on my chest Young Money Cash Money,

and Im eating all the rest n-gga no offence,
sorry if your offended,
riding high like Im on 54 inches,
man Id rather chill with 54 b-tches,
chi-chill like chi-chill like an eskimo
lets get mo, lets get mo b-tches
and I be like lets get mo b-tches,
Mr officer stop arresting your b-tches,
stop let the messy hoes mess with yo business,
mickey mouse cheese, hip hop Walt Disney,
shesh gosh Oshkosh B’gosh, smokin on that Bob Marley,
listening to Pete Tosh,
I do me, no I do three,
at A T I M E, why when we say we young mula,
the bitches leave ya’ll and relay run to us,
and payday comes sooner than later round here,
you see my sharks like I got some bait around here,
hey you better stop the hate around there,
before tommy mack and nina debate around there,
lyrics courtesy of killerhiphop.com
yeah you see it in my face I don’t care,
whole court hearing trial and the case around there,
Im the best thing yet I know I got that thing wet,
evvrybody want be fly but don’t know where there wings at,
ah hu….

Had to pause for a minute and im right back in it like the draws of the woman,
on a scale of 1 – 10 and my girl be a 20,
my girls so bad make a n-gga think he sinning,
my goons so pretty my goons are so with me,
haters got to go on iTunes to go get me
gaters by the doors, baboons and those grizzly’s
all come out me when Im on the microphone in the,
mic check 2 – 3, Im different like blue pee
and my girls be half naked like Betty Boop Be
like a hoopty, man the boy been riding
and I aint gas’d up because Im more like a hybrid,
you think Im stunting no Im just surviving,
and I’ve been here but my soul is just arriving,
look up in the air, its a crow its a robin,
no ceilings full dose
Im prescribing, medication free
and for meditation we
smoke some better tasting weed
that you’ll ever taste or see
S-H-A-R-P as tac hotter than
riding through a dessert on a camel back,
I done bin riding through wherever with the hammer strapped,
I aint lying, I can do whatever if Im planning that,
so I got my guns lets dance like fanny pack,
and we cooked the hard, cut the soft and bring the wammys back,
mafio b-tch where you muthf-cking family at,
call my n-gga gudda if you trying to get your mami back,
all up in another n-gga woman I be ramming that,
seeing through these see through n-ggas like their laminate,
hip hop so contaminate, I swear just examine that,
if im such a philanthropist the god to these evangelists,
I dress all Los Angeles but i love miami though,
I am so New Orleans yes I grew pistachios,
dat mean I go nuts at any beat they throw at me,
and the bitches is so at me,
and you know what they throw at me.
