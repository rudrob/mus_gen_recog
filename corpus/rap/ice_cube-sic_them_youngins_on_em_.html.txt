Yeah
Fuck with the godfather,
See what you get

Punishment
Conseqences and repercussions
Understand me
Y'all know what I do

[Refren]
Sic them youngins on em' (x8)

[I zwrotka]
Try to go ham on porky pig
Fucked up boy, that's what you did
Barbed wire, come through straight your wig
Y'all can't wrestle with the giant squid
Try to get that to the iron fist
Act all green, I'm hot as greeds
Yarn in my hand, no pinky wearin'
Godfather, nigga, I pull thre strings
Do what I tell'em
Buy what I sell'em
Puppet master
I'm Jim Hanson
See my muppets, they like duckets
Y'all feeling wrong when you see that bucket
Hit that coma, true when I wanna
Get another jar for the organ donor
Ice Cube, nigga, I know better
But you ain't gonna fight when you got that cheddar

[Refren]
Sic them youngins on em' (x8)

[II zwrotka]
Try to have beef with a fucking bull
With no teeth I'm about to pull
I'm that dentist about to finish
All the spoils go to the winners
Don't get mad cause my hands are clean
I'm the king, never flee on the scene
Wizard of Oz, if you need a brain
Need a hearth? Here's the start!
Don't you worry  if you need some courage
Y'all motherfuckers know here you heard it
Gangsta, gangsta, thank me now
Rap god, nigga, please take a bow 
Can't take bulshit from a cow
Don't ask who, I'mma fuck it out
Thristing howl will het you murdered
Come to the boss if you need some work
Come to the boss if you need some herd
White colar boy, if you check my shirt
Here come my son just like lebird
Gotta get my boys a pop of dirt
Putting the rap game on the lurp
Fuck with them and I will revert
Back to the old days
Back to the old ways
Back to the Ak's fucking up doorways

[Refren]
Sic them youngins on em' (x8)

[III zwrotka]
Try to play chicken with a fucking rooster
Don't you worry I'm not the shooter
I M A fucking computer
With a whole army of boosters
Nigga got out one piece
Five piece
Dime piece
Cause my crimmies move like zombies
Wha? Being heads to the 90's
Don't act like you don't  know where to find me 
Now, if you wanna get by me
Look at the all grinding
Niggas all behind me
You don't wanna go to war so you start to sing "Why can we be friends?"
We can be friends
Pussy ass niggas by extent
Pray to the God, repent your sins
Ice Cube ain't like the rest of them

[Refren]
Sic them youngins on em' (x8)

Let that be a lesson
to your monkey ass
Got that ass lumped up
and laid down

Try to go ham on porky pig
Fucked up boy, that's what you did

Try to go ham on porky pig
Fucked up boy, that's what you did
