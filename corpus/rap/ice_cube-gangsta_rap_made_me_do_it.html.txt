                    Blame me
You niggas know my pyrocalstic flow
You niggas know my pyrocalstic flow flow
You niggas know my pyrocalstic flow it's R.A.W R.A.W

You lookin at the ground wizzard war lord vocal chord so vicious
And I don't have to show riches to pull up pull off with some bad bitches
And it ain't about shivelry
It's about dope lyrics and delivery
It's about my persona ain't nothing like a man that can do wha he wanna
Ain't nothing like man on that you knew on the cornna
See em come up and f**k up the owna
See em throw up westside california
Nigga I'm hot as pheonix arizona
I'm utah I got multiple bitches
It's a new law keep a hold of yo riches
Dumb nigga don't spend it as soon as you get it and recognize I'm a captian you a lieutenant

I can say what I want to say ain't nohin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nigger ain't nohin to it gangsta rap made me do it
I can act like an animal ain't nohin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I eat you like a cannibal ain't nohin to it gangsta rap made me do it

I'm raw as a dirty needle
Choke an eagle
Just to feed all my people
Lyrically I'm so lethal
Plant thoughts in they mind just to defeat you
Ice Cube is a saga ya spit saliva
And I spit lava
I got the fearless flow
Don't get near this ho
If you sacred to go
I keep it gangsta and why should change that f**k all you muthafukas tryin to change rap
But arent you the same cat that sat back when they brought cocaine back

I'm tryin to get me a may back how you muthafukas gonna tell me don't say that you the ones where we learned it from I heard nigga back in 1971

So if I act like a pimp ain't nohin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nappy headed ho ain't nohin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I shoot up your college ain't nohin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I rob you of knowledge ain't nohin to it gangsta rap made me do it

Thank God when I bless the mic
You finally get to hear the shit that you like
A nigga talkin bout real life so you can try to get this shit right
Use your brain not your back use your brain not a gat
It's a party not a jack(for real)
Don't be scared of them people
Walk up in there and show them that you equal(f**k them f**k them)
Don't be material a nigga grew up on milk and cereal
I never for got vaness and impearial
Look at my life Ice Cube is a miracle
It could be you if you was this lyrical
It could be her if she was this spritual
Becuz me and allah go back like cronies
I don't got to be fake becuz he is my homie

If I sell a liitle crack ain't nohin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I die in Iraq ain't nohin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I take you for granted ain't nohin to it gangsta rap made me do it
If I f**k up the planet ain't nohin to it gangsta rap made me do it

You niggas know my pyrocalstic flow
You niggas know my pyrocalstic flow flow flow
You niggas know my pyrocalstic flow It's R.A.W R.A.W
