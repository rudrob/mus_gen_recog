Turn my fucking beat up

[Refren] Chris Brown:

Uh, yeah! We can do anything
Walk into anywhere and buy anything!
I'll be chilling, I don't worry about anything
Why stop now? I can have everything!
Yeah! I can have everything!
Yeah! I can have everything!
Yeah! I can have everything!
Why stop now? I can have everything!

[Zwrotka 1] Busta Rhymes:

(Now!)
Every single time I get up in the building
Then I touch it, and I get it poppin'
You can never stop it and how long it got 'em hung in
And they're wonderin' on how my nigga does it
When I'm blackin' every hood and every street and then I flood it
Makin' every DJ wanna bring it back and they robbin'
Makin' otha niggas starvin ain't no food up in the cupboards
See the way I got 'em spittin' gotta nigga runnin'
From the way that I be gettin' on the beat and I'll be
Dumbin' (I'll be dumbin')

Shit, I wanna see y'all do dat on YouTube

Lemme gibble in and dabble with the flow
Lemme show you niggas how I really mix it up
(Yep!)
I'm a slow it down a little
Naw think ya better mean to flip it up
(Kill 'em!)
Switch it up I'll probly pitch it never wanna see ya
Bottles in ya hands, nigga get it up
(Ho!)
Throw my money all around until it hit the ground
I'm makin' shorty work before she pick it up
(Whoo!)
You know the shit was kinda dead 'fore I had to
Step up all up in the spot and really lift it up
(Damn!)
And soon I busta nigga head in and then I throw a little
Coke up in the street until they sniff it up
[Sniff]
And see they lovin' when I come and hit it up
I kill it 'til a nigga 'body get the stiffin' up
And need to betta know that I can do anything that I want
Niggas already be knowin' I'm a GIVE IT UP!

[Refren] Chris Brown:

Uh, yeah! We can do anything
Walk into anywhere and buy anything!
I'll be chilling, I don't worry about anything
Why stop now? I can have everything!
Yeah! I can have everything!
Yeah! I can have everything!

[Zwrotka 2] Busta Rhymes:

All right, I'm a let you niggers calm down for a minute
And get your shit together!
Here's what I need y'all to do!
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
Let's go!

Ok, come around, see me put it down just a little bit
Ball and I'm heavy, y'all already know...
Somebody better get the crown when the nigga spit
Hurry! Make sure you polish it a little 'fore you bring it to me while I like it down with another hit
(You're ready), and you ain't even gotta ask
When you already know another bang is what you gonna get!
Yeah! Better bounce when a nigga say something's like magic
When the niggers been pressed out
And you're really with me, and you're ready, let's go!
Rhyme with a nigger like we're on a metro
Y'all already know I kill anyone, anywhere, anything from the very intro
And I beat the most everything
And you should have knew that form the very get go!

[Refren] Chris Brown:

Uh, yeah! We can do anything
Walk into anywhere and buy anything!

[Zwrotka 3] Busta Rhymes:

Just watch 'em close, see how they bug on how the God delivers
Now we're blacking in this bitch, until the police and get us!
Watch so you could see! (The Conglomorate)
Who fucking with us?
I could shit and fart all on the beat and kill a couple niggers!
Oh, oh!

Everybody know what the fuck it is
True!
And then I think I'm a beat them in the heads
Niggers know I do it till I split a couple of wigs
And you know that when I got him
And I hit him from the bottom
You don't want a nigger really though!
And I'll be doing anything that I want
No matter where we're at, I'm a let it go!

[Refren] Chris Brown:

Uh, yeah! We can do anything
Walk into anywhere and buy anything!
I'll be chilling, I don't worry about anything
Why stop now? I can have everything!
Yeah! I can have everything!
Yeah! I can have everything!
Yeah! I can have everything!
Why stop now? I can have everything!
