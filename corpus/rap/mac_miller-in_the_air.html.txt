                    I dont think they know it yet, but I do, I do
And if you f-ckin’ with it then you my dude, my dude
We always down to dap or give a pound to those who got their thumbs in the air

[Mac Miller - Verse 1]
Hey, everything good right now
Little bit of money make your boy ride down
Thinking I could probably figure out my style on a stage
Looking at a big high crowd
They go insane when I run out the stage
Cause we don’t give a f-ck, don’t need to act our age, hey
When I’m old I’ma spend my days, layin’ with my girl on the beach in the shade
Have every single thing I can name
Thank god everyday I dont sleep in the rain
Blessed with some success so I’ma try my best to
Live my life right, when I see God he’ll be impressed ’cause
I’ve been on my grind, thinking I’ll be fine if I take my time
Working so hard I might break my spine
So all yall goin’ see this face of mine
There’s different ways to shine
I’ma find my own, know when I disappear
I’ma find my way back home ’cause…

[Hook]
I dont think they know it yet, but I do, I do
And if you f-ckin’ with it then you my dude, my dude
We always down to dap or give a pound to those who got their thumbs in the air

[Mac Miller - Verse 2]
Days go by and I think that I
Maybe going crazy, maybe loose my mind
Looking at a constellation
Me and God have a conversation
God and I, sorry about the lingo
Just kick it in the cut playing bingo
I be all over the beat like Ringo
Look sweet honey bee gonna sting though
I’m here, wanna do my thang
You can roll no matter who you bring
Like your wifey wanna loose that ring
I don’t pay her no mind, I just want, I just want, I just want the paper
Bring the games a little more flavor
Say wat up, take a flick with a hater
Throwing a deuce like see you later,
That’s funny, all I really want is a little cash money
Then life is gonna be so sweet, nah it aint a hotel, nah it aint a hotel,
I’m next, shhhh, don’t tell

[Hook x2]
I dont think they know it yet, but I do, I do
And if you f-ckin’ with it then you my dude, my dude
We always down to dap or give a pound to those who got their thumbs in the air
