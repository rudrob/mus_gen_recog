                    Chorus/Intro [Skylar Grey]:
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

Verse 1 [Eminem]:
I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm saying that
Y'all starting to creep in, everyday its so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that cause no one see's my vision 
When I play it for 'em they just say it's wack
But they don't know what dope is...
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breath new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me, you lost son D, it's fighting you,
it's dark, let me turn on the lights and brighten it'll enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick you
You gon' either wanna fight me when I get off this fucking mic
Or you gonna hug me but I'm out of options
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE I CAN DO 'CAUSE...

Chorus [Skylar Grey]:
I'm about to lose my mind
you've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
to bring me back to life

Verse 2 [Eminem]:
It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say there just pieces so I'm puzzled, 'Cause the shit I did
Is crazy but your either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision you keep questioning yourself
Second guessing and its almost like your begging for my help
Like I'm your LEADER, you supposed to fucking be my MENTOR
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you, who believed in me
When everyone was telling you don't sign me
Everyone at the fucking label, lets tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I'm crying in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe its my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't giving up FAITH and you ain't giving up on ME
GET UP DRE, I'M DYING, I NEED YOU, COME BACK FOR FUCK SAKE 'CAUSE...

Chorus [Skylar Grey]:
I'm about to lose my mind
you've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
to bring me back to life
bring me back to life
bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor
to bring me back to life

Verse 3 [Dr. Dre]:
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was riding to the death but where fuck are they now
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them
All I see is Slim, fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fucking backstabbers, when the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fucking wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask where the fuck we've been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack maggots and the crackers ass
Little crack a jack beat making wack math, backwards producers
I'm back bastards!
One more CD and then I'm packing up my bags and as I'm leaving
I'll guarantee they scream DRE DON'T LEAVE US LIKE THAT MAN 'CAUSE...

Chorus/Outro [Skylar Grey]:
I'm about to lose my mind
you've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
to bring me back to life
