                    [Verse 1 - Coolio]
Get your back, call tomorrow, life is borrowed
all your tears in sorrow and bring it back and that's a fact
where would you be at, make sure you're pushin' harder to it
the game was changed when the bullshit was brought here
our sets are fallin' now they live in love
we got five bucks or four reproduction of the clothing and gloves
you rather see me in a cell, than see me make my mail
and when the story he tell, he trying to make you fail
trying to make some money lope but money makes no man
if you have no pen than you have no money in your hand
we're so dope, dive and steal, anything but payed for real
damn you folks, if you wouldn't choked when you forgot to keep it real
cops came back, rubbers in the back
what you snap when you couldn't lack
now you feel the pressure when you didn't count your blessings
now we're gone, you are alone
told your mama that you was grown
one to the neck and three to the chest 
when you ran for your life all alone
now you're gone, now would your homies die for you, fool

[Chorus - Coolio]
I don't wanna die right, he doesn't wanna die right
no nobody wanna die but somebody's gotta die tonight
she doesn't wanna die right, they don't wanna die right
no nobody wanna die but somebody's gotta die tonight

[Verse 2 - Krayzie Bone]
I've cacker-rouches in my black boots
nigga we sued them 'till they were in the mud
we hold the coffin, it isn't possible they got away running muthafucka
in the dust, cought up in the ghetto tradegy
that makes a nigga to fall, unless he's tall
this is reality mixed with society
families tored apart but this tearing apart was hard
stand and askin' where is God, dont you try to play missunder Lord
and the rest has been said, say rest in peace 'cause my nigga is dead
before they beginning to run and make everything go under
I'm gonna knock as hard as my mother not gonna wonder
'cause I knew it'd be me
everyone's coming gathering to see
remain in flames what I used to be, this is no more R.I.P
you never know when they're coming to get ya
but have them bullets ready for protection
take them bodies who has fallen as a collection
but when they attack, you gotta go, we're under control
we gather to squeese us
we hope many men will recover in smoke
'cause we never die in casulties, and we are the casulties of war
we are the casulties of war, we are the casulties of war

[Chorus - Coolio]
I don't wanna die right, he doesn't wanna die right
no nobody wanna die but somebody's gotta die tonight
she doesn't wanna die right, they don't wanna die right
no nobody wanna die but somebody's gotta die tonight

[Verse 3 - Coolio]
I saw them coming from a mile away
I couldn't stay I had to make my getaway, I lived to find another day
that's how it goes when this game we play
everybody on board got a price to pay
you better pay attention to what I say, go to Hell if you don't pray
these streets are hard, walkin' down the Boulevard
like walkin through a prison yard 
you never know when the bullets fly off
the pressure is on your money, boy beginning to fall
and your name gotta be stong to make them fools run from court
oh man your in jail but you cant call your crew
'cause those niggas dont used to be a crew, now they're after you, ooo
people seen that you used to be a teen
but you ran against the Benz, niggas on the scene
I guess they sucked out your brain , cut you in your jeans
lucky you're not what they hate but they beat up what they see
don't you ever go 'round and scream it seperates the boys from men
cought your closest on your seat
and that's my dearest fairest friend

[Chorus x2 - Coolio]
I don't wanna die right, he doesn't wanna die right
no nobody wanna die but somebody's gotta die tonight
she doesn't wanna die right, they don't wanna die right
no nobody wanna die but somebody's gotta die tonight
(We are the casulties of war
we are the casulties of war
we are the casulties of war)

[Repeat until fade - Krayzie Bone]
We are the casulties of war
