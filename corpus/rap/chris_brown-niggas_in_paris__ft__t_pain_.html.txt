                    It’s your turn Chris
Lets go baby
I SAID LETS GOOOO….

Look, I just came to get rid of every nigga
To murder every rapper, 
Watch a nigga come up outta me
I’m stuntin’ hard on these muthaf-ckas
Flying on the VMA’s. 
Evel Knievel, the nigga proud of me
I’m drinking this shit til 5 in the morning
Your girls number 1 pick, call me Mr Lottery
I let a hater nigga die, POW, like it’s suicide
I ain’t giving no more f-ckin’ apologies
Stunt so hard, that shit crazy
Aint shit free, f-ck you pay me

Heron flow from the 80′s, 
My chain on me like we made it
My Kinfolk got 10 hoes, 
5 whites, 2 blacks like 3 Asians
My Benzo got damn hoe, 
Nigga take this shit I’m too faded
Go ‘head and bring yo crown over
Ass kisser, brown noser, 
F-ck yo luck, I smoke clovers
I’m partying with boat owners
Marilyn Monroe hoes all on us
Rookie tryna get ya signing bonus
Nigga look at my chain man, 
I paint ya face, you a clown homie
Not tryna throw subliminal, 
My Porsche got 4?

Even if its just 10 of ya’ll 
I put in the old school and 
You pin up dolls, yes
That shit crazy, don’t you play me
You tryna get on this bus, 
Bitch sign this waiver
Hol’ up, hol’ up, gimme that 
Chardonnay and that Marvin Gaye shit
But hol’ up, my conversation 
Too complicated, this bitch too basic
You aint no groupie girl and 
You know that I won’t say shit
You got skeletons in your closet
I got aliens in my basement
