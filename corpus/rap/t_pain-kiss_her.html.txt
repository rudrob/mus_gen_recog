                    Had a girl that,
She wanna be famous
She wanna touch me
With all her fingers
Then her friend
Came and said
"Girl, I love ya"
Cause' they're like kissing sisters
And who wanna be their brother?
Ahha
It was
Pink Lipgloss
Aha!
And Red Lipstick
I'm thinkinn'
I'm dreamin'
Then they got closer
And closer
And closer
And then
I got right up in the middle
And I said girl

Ref.:
I wanna see you kiss your friend
Kiss her like you mean it
You gotta do it right in front of my bed
I wanna see you kiss your friend
Kiss her like you mean it
And if you do it
You can come to my place
I wanna see you kiss your friend
Kiss her like you mean it
I'm thinkinn'
I'm dreamin'
I wanna see you kiss your friend
Kiss her like you mean it
You and
Your friend
