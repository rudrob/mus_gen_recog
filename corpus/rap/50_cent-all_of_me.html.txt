                    feat. Mary J. Blige


[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Now If I give you all of me
What you gone give me back?
Your body is callin' me
Got me feelin' like a fiend on crack
Why you gonna make me fall in love?
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now If I give you all of me
What you gone give me back?

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Lets start with the moon and the stars, whatever you into
They money I aquire mama make it all simple
Flashback '03, papparazzi flashin' flicks
I moved away, hustle hard, now I got a six stash
Tell me you miss me, baby come here and kiss me
It just happened so quickly, feels like I hopped off a bus and got in a Bentley
Its gangsta my music even when its the smooth shit
You can hate me cause I hurt you but I aint even do it
They predicted it all I dont know how he knew it
He said women from Hollywood are "Liar, liar, liars"
Fuck em they get ya heated then deny it like Mariah
Fast forward to '06, Im still on fire
The world is still turning, my records are still earnin'
Dough come quicker and quicker, flow gets sicker and sicker
Straight up and down baby, Im a special kinda nigga

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Now If I give you all of me
What you gone give me back?
Your body is callin' me
Got me feelin' like a fiend on crack
Why you gonna make me fall in love?
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now If I give you all of me
What you gone give me back?

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Life is short baby, be apart of my dreams
I own Ferarri horses, my Lambhorgini leans
So mean, I have niggas hatin' on me
God gave me a gift, Im supposed to be rich
Im supposed to ride through the hood and make niggas sick
When my homies put in work, they supposed to get it
With a piece of chain thick, go and buy em some bricks
I aint make that up, this is how its suppose to be kid
You should feel like a life, but it gave back bad time
When I smile your smile should be as big as mines
Girl to know me's to love me, Im one of a kind
Even when you hate me you love me, forever your mine

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Now If I give you all of me
What you gone give me back?
Your body is callin' me
Got me feelin' like a fiend on crack
Why you gonna make me fall in love?
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now If I give you all of me
What you gone give me back?
