Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Eminem]:

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
High of a love drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer
I suffocate
And right before im about to drown she resuscitates me
She fucking hates me and I love it
Wait, where you going, I'm leaving you
No you ain't come back
We're running right back
Here we go again It's so insane
Cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind in his back
She's Lois Lane but when it's bad it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snap, Who's that dude
I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Rihanna]:

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Eminem]:

You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe
When you barely You meet 
And neither warn you even know what hit him
Got that warm fuzzy feeling
Yeah, Cheers, Just to get him
Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at him
You swore you never hit him, never do not  to hurt him
Now you really reach each other's space, spewing venom and these words
When you spit him, you push pull each other's, hands scratch, claw, bit him, throw him down, pin him
So lost in the moments
When you hit him
It's the rage that took over it controls you both
So they say it's best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know
Cause today that was yesterday
Yesterday is over it's a different day
Sound like broken records, plan over, but you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it windowpain

[Rihanna]:

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Eminem]:

Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me
But when it comes to love you just blinded
Baby please come back
It wasn't you baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away that
Come inside pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault
Look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the dry wall
Next time there will be no next time
I apologize even know I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back
I know I'm lie
She ever tries to fucking leave again
I'm tie to the bed and set the house on fire

[Rihanna]:
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
