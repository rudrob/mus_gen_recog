                    [Chorus]
[2X]
Give 'em what they want (c'mon)
Give 'em what they want (c'mon)
Give 'em what they want
They all can't get it

Give 'em what they want (c'mon)
Give 'em what they want (c'mon)
(give it to 'em!!)
(owwwww!)

[Verse #1]
Cats slide to the hood, but I walk through it
Holdin' my fuckin' dick and that's all to it
This ain't no new shit, told you when I met cha
Show some fuckin' respect, knock before ya enter
Bet cha, if its me that's comin' to get cha
Its gonna be a back down on that stretcher
For real, ya'll niggaz don't know pain
Cause ya'll niggaz don't know me
And well that's my name
Ain't a fuckin' thing changed still the same
y'all got dope but rob niggaz
so be mob niggaz Y.O be hard niggaz
School street I rep that , beat and scar niggaz
Respect that and step back
Come at me sideways and get laid down where you stand
[gun load] (bla-dow!) with the cannons
So stop all the dirty fuckin' looks
Cause y'all niggaz ain't fuckin' crooks fuck around and get took

[Chorus]

I make moves, I break rules
Pistol whip Niggaz if they got fake jewels
I take tools (get money with 'em)
I make rules (get bloody in 'em)
Fuckin' with that nigga Earl Simmons
Will have you in the middle a The ocean...swimming
Up to creek with no paddle, y'all niggaz fuck
Right when u should of bucked, y'all niggaz ducked
Stuck 'em down that's your muther fuckin' luck (what!?)
Clown! what now!? keep fuckin' playin'
I'm gonna keep a nigga 6 feet deep layin'
Shit keeps sprayin' what y'all sayin?
Don't want nothing'...(c'mon)

[Chorus 2X]
