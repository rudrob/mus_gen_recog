                    Uhh, 
Hit them with a lil' ghetto gospel 

[Chorus - Elton John:] 
Those who wish to follow me (My ghetto gospel) 
I welcome with my hands 
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold 
And peace to this young warrior without the sound of guns 

[2Pac] 
If I could recollect before my hood dayz 
I'd sit and reminisce and thinkin of bliss of good dayz 
i stop and stare at the younger, my heart goes to'em 
They tested, it was stressed that they under 
And nowadays, things changed 
Everyone's ashamed to the youth cuz the truth looks strange 
And for me it's revesed, we left them a world that's cursed, and it hurts 
cause any day they'll push the button 
and all good men like Malcolm X and Bobby Hutton, died for nothin 
Don't it make you get teary, the world looks dreary 
 when you wipe your eyes, see it clearly 
there's no need for you to fear me 
if you take the time to hear me, maybe you can learn to cheer me 
it aint about black or white, cuz we're human 
I hope you see the light before its ruined 
my ghetto gospel 

[Chorus - Elton John] 

[2Pac] 
Tell me do you see that old lady aint it sad 
Living outta bag, but she's glad for the little things she has 
And over there there's a lady, crack got her crazy 
Guess who's givin birth to a baby 
I don't trip and let it fade me, from outta the frying pan 
We're jumping to another form of slavery 
Even now I keep discouraged 
Wonder if they take it all back while I still keep the courage 
I refuse to be a role model 
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottle 
I make mistakes, I learn from everyone 
And when its said and done 
I bet this Brotha be a better one 
If I'm upset, you don't stress 
Never forget, that God hasn't finished with me yet 
I feel his hand on my brain 
When I write rhymes, I go blind, and let the lord do his thang 
But am I less holy 
Cuz I choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies 
Before we find world peace 
We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets
My ghetto gospel 

[Chorus - Elton John] 

[2Pac] 
Lord can you hear me speak!! 
To pay the price of being hell bound...
