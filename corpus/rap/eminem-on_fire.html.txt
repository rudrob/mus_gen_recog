Critics Never Got Nothin Nice To Say man
you know the one thing i notice about critics man?
is.. critics never ask me how my day went
well imma tell em

Verse 1:
yesterday my dog died, i hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
said next time you blow up try to spit a flow
you wanna criticize dog try a little mo
im so tired of this i could blow, fire in the hole
im fired up so fire up the lighter and the dro
better hold on a little tighter here i go
flows tighter, hot headed as ghostrider
cold hearted as spiderman throwin a spider in the snow
so ya better get to blowin in flow rider inside of a lowrider with no tires in the hole
why am i like this? why is winter cold
why is it when i talk im so biased to the hose (host?)
listen dog christmas is off this is as soft as it gets
this isnt gob this is a blister in the salt
those are your wounds this is the salt
so get lost
shit dissin me is just like pissin off the wizard of oz
wrap a lizard in gauze beat you in the jaws with it
grab the scissors and saws and
cut out your livers gizzards and balls
throw you in the middle of the ocean in the blizzard with jaws
so sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
then discribe how it tasted like dessert to us all
got the gall to make chris piss in his draws
ticklin him go to his grave, skip him and visit his dog

Hook:
you on fire
thats how ya know your on a roll
cause when you hot its like your burnin up everyone elses cold
your on fire
man im so fuckin sick i got ambulances pullin me over and shit
your on fire
ya need to stop drop and roll cause when you say the shit to give the whole hip hop shop the blow
your on fire.. your on fire

Verse 2:
I just wrote a bullshit hook in between two long ass verses if you mistook the for a song, look
this aint a song its a warnin to brooke, hogan and david cook
that the crook just took over so book
run as fast as you can, stop writin and kill it
im lightning in a skillet your a fuckin flash in a pan
i pop up you bitches scatter like hot grease splashin a fan
mr mathers is the man
yeah im pissed but i would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
come back and whip your ass with it again
salivas like sufiric acid in your hand itll eat through anything metal the ass of iron man
turn him into plastic so for you to think that you could stand a fuckin chance is assanine
yeah ask the nine man
hit a blind man with a coloring book and told him color inside the lines or get hit widda fine crayon
fuck it i aint playin
pull up in a van and hop out at a homeless man holdin a sign sayin
vietnam vet.. im out my fuckin mind man
kick over the can beat his ass and leave him 9 grand
so if i seem a little mean to you this aint savage you aint never seen the brew
you wanna get graphic we can go the scenic route
you couldnt make a belemic puke on a piece of fuckin corn and peanut boo (?)
sayin you sick quit playin you prick dont nobody care
then why the fuck am i yellin at air

nobody will fuckin test me cause these hos wont even dare
