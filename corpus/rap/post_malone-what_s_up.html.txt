Like what's up?
What's up with that, what's up?
Tell me what's up with that, what's up?
What's up?
What's up with that, what's up?
What's up?
Like what's up?
What's up with that, what's up?
Tell me what's up with that, what's up?
What's up?
What's up with that, what's up?
What's up?

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
What's up with that what's up
I'm trying to talk, just fuck up
Quit fucking with them buzzards
I'm tryna call your number
You've been playing way too long
I've been smoking on that strong
In the studio too long
Blowing on that potent
I'm just trying to get that on
And I ain't tryna stunt man, I'm tryna be honest
And the style, that's swag, bitch you know I be on it
I get you what you want, I get you what you want
With that Christian Louboutin, I get you that shoe on
You a shoo-in for first place
But I'm feeling so blue, ay
And I'm sipping a forty
She keep playing like Blu-ray
Drop the top on that toupee
And I might cop that to-day
But I need me a you-day
And I'm just tryna hit it, we could go up on a Tuesday (Like Makonnen, like Makonnen)
And I'm trying to fuck, why you playing with me?
Why you playing with me?
Girl I'm trying to call your number, trying to call your number

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 1st]
What's up with the what's up
Line going crazy
I got two phones, one an I, one a flip
That's the one all the flips hit
She call me when she wanna do the gymnast shit
Got her doing somersaults, Gabby Douglas back flips
So when's the last time you seen a big dick?
She said she like to kiss cause I got big lips
And we got all that chemistry
She show me images
Pop a bean now we limitless
You ain't gotta be real, baby
We could just pretend, aw
I got her coughing and wheezing every time I pass her the indo
Aw, god damn bruh, all this sauce
Keypad, unlock, then she pop her top
Girl pick up the phone when I call you
1st down, touchdown, I'mma go for two on you
I ain't trying to put the pressure on you
I got girls from here to Arizona
Like what's up
