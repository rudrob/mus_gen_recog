                    It's time to take you 
To its full potential
Peep this and drop some game 
On the instrumental and
it's essential that you listen close 
And better tell your folks
that the loc has spoke
first things first since 
Your date of birth
you've been kinda confused 
About what your life is worth
50 million times your weight in gold
you gotta take control
cause fools don't live to be old
you can do anything 
That you want to do
all you got to do is to put 
Your brain into it
take your time and 
Educate your mind and
in the long run 
I'm sure you'll find that
if you walk the walk 
You can talk the talk
but don't wait too long 
Cuz life is short
and remember, 
No matter what they tellin' you
if you try, you can be a winner too

Keep on pushing
moving on up
everybody we're moving on up
moving on up
you're a winner
you gotta keep pushing
moving on up
everybody we're moving on up
moving on up
you're a winner

Everybody rise men and 
Women boys and girls
each one teach one 
But we can't save the world
all at one day you got 
To take it play by play
and once you're on the path
don't you ever go a stray
you can lead a horse to water 

But you can't make him drink
you can give a man some wizdom 
But you can't make him man feel
Cuz stich in time saves nine
Early bird gets the worm
But all you can think 
About is gettin attention for your perm
If knowledge is power and 
Power is knowledge, then
How so many idiots 
Be graduating from colleges
Better to be silent and 
Be thought a fool
Than to speak and 
Remove all doubt

You know what 
I'm talking about
when opportunity knocks 
You better let him in 
And sit him on down
And try to be his friend
In order to be a professional 
First you got to be a beginner
But if you keep on 
Pushing you can be a winner

Red yellow black white or brown
if every mind their business 
We can all get down
it all starts at home
coz once 
They're grown 
They're gone
and once they're on their own
you got to leave them alone
be a leader but 
If you can't be a leader
make sure your leader 
Is a damn good teacher and
imagine if you was in a car 
And your life was wasted
somebody was on your back 
And you had to give him some space

Put the petal to the metal and match at low
but make sure you stay in your lane
and go strof to strof
we don't need no penaltys or eliminations
or disqualifications
what we need is penetrations
now what you heard before but 
Sometimes life is what you make it
I ain't the one thats known 
For fakin or perpetratin
if Albert was an Einstein
and Phillis was a Diller
and Michael Jackson was a thriller
then you could be a winner

Chorus extended
Fade out

                    Â
