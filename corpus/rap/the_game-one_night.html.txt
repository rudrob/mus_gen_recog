                    Chorus:

I only fuck with you, on two occasions,
When I'm drunk and I'm high,
I would be broke, if I could be with you,
That is why it's for one night, (what? What what what what?)

Verse 1:

I'm a motherfuckin' gangbanging nightmare,
Wake up motherfuckers, I traded in my white Nike Airs,
For a red pair of Converse, Back to the hood,
My own *****z acting like I turned my back on the hood,
I use my rap money to put crack in the hood,
Even brought the ***** Dr. Dre back to the hood,
I show *****z the Bentley then let you drive it,
Gone for two days and I ain't even check the mileage,
When we was fighting with crips it weren't 'bout no dollars,
It was about selling dope to put our kids through college,
I'm sitting on the block reminiscing for hours,
Wiping my tears 'cus now half of my *****z is cowards,
And now it's still fucking with *****z after I got shot,
And didn't get one hospital visit,
My homie Snoop told me there'd be days like this,
It hurt my heart to say this shit,

Chorus:

I only fuck with you, on two occasions,
When I'm drunk and I'm high,
I would be broke, if I could be with you,
That is why it's for one night, (what? What what what what?)

Verse 2:

Red bandana in my back pocket I'm for real,
This ain't pastel colour cacky suit and I ain't for real,
I don't run about shit I pull my gun about shit,
And let everything fly to keep my son up outta this,
I thought you loved me *****, talk is cheap,
Remember the bullet holes in my son's car seat?
My baby momma found 4 shells I din't get one “Keep your head up”
All I got was “Keep it real” keep it real my *****z?
Last year alone I spent $1.5 mil on my *****z,
After the bullshit, I stayed right there,
Took you to award shows, “There go Jay right there”,
“Where?” “Right there!” I had all you *****z in suits,
Cleaner than a pair of fresh Nike Airs,
I'm supposed to enjoy this shit but it's quite clear,
The last 12 months been a fucking nightmare.
Chorus:

I only fuck with you, on two occasions,
When I'm drunk and I'm high,
I would be broke, if I could be with you,
That is why it's for one night, (what? What what what what?)

Verse 3:

This shit worse than arguing with my bitch,
I gone been through more up and downs than an Impala switch,
Get you hand out my pocket *****, go fish,
I was born by myself so I don't owe y'all shit,
***** you tell me what you want me to do,
Drop my son off at home and come bang witchu?
Oh now it's “Fuck Game” nah ***** fuck you!
I put that on my life, matter a fact that's on Paru,
And reality is I get dot to end up in a cemetery, right beside you,
We can both rot, angels lying over my head, but the devil's inside yo' box,
You wanted my shine then I gave you ice,
Gave you a second chance then you played me twice,
Couldn't be a real homeboy to save you life,
I shoulda took Dr. Dre's advice.

Chorus:

I only fuck with you, on two occasions,
When I'm drunk and I'm high,
I would be broke, if I could be with you,
That is why it's for one night, (what? what what what what?)
