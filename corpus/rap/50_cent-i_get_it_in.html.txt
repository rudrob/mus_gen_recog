                    Yeah, na na na na
Yeah
na na na now me i’m the life of the party
A little bit of juice little bit of the gin
A little bit of Mo et play bottles of the Rose
Feel a little buzz then i’m gettin’ it in
Now me I get it in, I get it in
Me I get it in, I get it in
Now me I get it in, I get it in
Me I get it in, I get it in

Look as soon as I step in the club i swear
My nigga you can feel the attention shift
Started around twelve ended up around two
I better leave with more hoes than I came here with
I can’t be responsible for what I say or I do
when i talk intoxicated
Shorty say i told her I love heri put her out the next mornin’
sayin’ b!tch I must have been faded
I don’t know what you heard about me
but the word about me
that I’m no trick I’m no sucker i’m no chump
I be in the VIP with my niggaz ’round me
sayin’ y’all can have whatever you want

Me I get it in
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
That’s Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday we get it in

I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty give me a drink
(repeat) 

I hate to say I told you so, but I told you so,
i go hard when it’s time to play
Shorty get to droppin’ it low, like the dancers do,
in the Go-Go in front of me
She know i like to see her dance she get to breakin’ it down
we get the bouncin’ outta control
Because i got a hell of a flow we got paper to blow
my whole clique pop bottles galore
It’s no secret the hood done peeped it
when we come through son we look like bread
My ‘89 grind make my old nine shine
like we been movin’ bricks ’round this bitch for years
I say i get it in it’s because i get it in
now shorty there a eight but her friend near a ten
I finna spend my G she f@#k with me i’m into win,
i’m cooler than her ma then we do this sh!t again

Me I get it in
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
That’s Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday

Friday we get it in

I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty give me a drink
(repeat) 

Na na na na now me i’m the life of the party
A little bit of juice little bit of the gin
A little bit of Mo et play bottles of the Rose
Feel a little buzz then i’m gettin’ it in
Now me I get it in, I get it in
Me I get it in, I get it in
Now me I get it in, I get it in
Me I get it in, I get it in
