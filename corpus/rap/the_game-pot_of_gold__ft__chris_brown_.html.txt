                    [Hook: Chris Brown]
All the spotlight
Is not for me
I close my eyes
And imagine I'm home
I miss the days
When life was simple
But if I never tried to follow that rainbow
In search of the pot of gold
(woooah, woooah)
In search of the pot of gold

[Verse 1 - The Game]
There's a mother out there right now
About to have the next LeBron
Searching for a pot of gold like a leprechaun
They say death comes in threes
Who's next in line?
And I just lost a best friend for the second time
Now I'm on a quest to find peace
Still gotta carry my piece and
"Soo Woo!" when it's reppin' time
Y'all don't understand.. I'm misunderstood
Give Interscope two more albums
Then I'm done for good
Sold 10 million records, ain't leave the hood
It's a cold world, everybody need a hood
And everybody doing time, stay headstrong
You still got a chance to
Live even though you're dead wrong

[Hook: Chris Brown]
All the spotlight
Is not for me
I close my eyes
And imagine I'm home
I miss the days
When life was simple
But if I never tried to follow that rainbow
In search of the pot of gold
(woooah, woooah)
In search of the pot of gold

[Verse 2 - The Game]
Sometimes I try to do good but I just can't be
It's hard to get myself to do things that ain't me
And y'all should thank me
But my haters busy trying to send me home early
But you can't New Orlean Saint me
I ain't a saint B, I ain't a god God
I ain't a angel neither but I try hard y'all
I'm lighting up for all my soldiers at war
As I sit back and watch
The ashes on my cigar fall
Wayne just came home and
Tip back on the yard dawg
Guess Pujols ain't the only one playing hard ball

[Hook: Chris Brown]
All the spotlight
Is not for me
I close my eyes
And imagine I'm home
I miss the days
When life was simple
But if I never tried to follow that rainbow
In search of the pot of gold
(woooah, woooah)
In search of the pot of gold

See the thing about all of us is
You never know just what we bout

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Oh the spotlight
Is not for me
I close my eyes
And imagine I'm home
I miss the days
When life was simple
But if I never tried to follow that rainbow
In search of the pot of gold
(woooah, woooah)
In search of the pot of gold
