                    [Intro - Lil Wayne]
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Uh

[Chorus - Lil Wayne]
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood

[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
Find out where your parents stay
Tell my goons to go straight to your mama room
What’s in your pockets? What’s in your pocketbook?
We think the Bible’s a comic book
Bitch this Hollygrove, too far from Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
I got cocaine that’s so good, need a name
Call it milk, because milk does the body good
I got this heat on my waist
So somebody better monitor the thermometer
I just eat pussy and pussy ass niggas all day
And I ain’t even kinda full

[Chorus - Lil Wayne]
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood

[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
Woo, I went from Birdman to Beverly Hills
Show me ya tits, I’ll show you my weapon and grill
And heaven is real
I get an actress into my bedroom, she lay down and say: “let’s make a film”
I be like: “action”, I hold her hair down by her neck, this how breath taking feel
Family first, you’ll get your family killed
That’s if you squeal, pop-pop close range
Hold that gun like the photographer hold the camera still
Bad bitch ridin’ my dick, she swerve cause another bitch grabbin’ the wheel
I ask ‘em to chill
They both look at me say: “shut up”, I say: “my lips are sealed”
Ooh, I come from Hollygrove, I done went Hollywood
I was a match made in heaven when hell was a pile of wood
I run through hell with gasoline drawers on, stop, tell the Devil that God is good
Entrepreneur in a Bentley drop-top Azure, vagina connoisseur out the hood
I come from Hollygrove, everyday Halloween
We shoot your block up and just say we shot a scene
This is a robbery, I let the chopper squeeze
Turn you to cottage cheese, been on my feet
Since I was wearing Wallabees
Well paparazzi, I need my privacy
Fuck yo’ photography, I react violently
Make sure your camera get my good side of me
Lorddd, I come from Hollygrove
Hollywood should make a movie about Hollygrove
Woo, whoever play me should get a Oscar and a Golden Globe
This ain’t no movie, this is real shit
I don’t need a script cause I know my role
My Hollywood bitch just overdosed
All she could snort, more coke than Pinocchio
I come from the streets, but got superstar written all over my face
That’s why these hoes in my face
I come from Hollygrove
I moved to Hollywood just to Californicate
Bapapapaapapappa
I ain’t finna shoot and tell them don’t check the gate

[Chorus - Lil Wayne]
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood

[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]
Fall asleep to the gunshots
Wake up and smell the embalming fluid
I come from Hollygrove, my bitch from Hollywood
When I fuck her, she say: “Hallelujah”
Hollygrove too far from Hollywood
Ohh, but I done went Hollywood
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Hollygrove ain’t far from H-Town
We used to drive back and forth with the work praying
Lord please don’t let this car break down
Haha
H-Town
Lord I’ve done went from Hollygrove to H-Town

[Verse 4 - Lil Wayne]
Hollygrove to Houston
Got a bad 5th Ward bitch that be boostin’
Sometimes she doze off, that’s the lean I excuse it
She said: “if it ain’t chopped and screwed, it ain’t music”
She say I never take her out, we went to eat at Houston’s
Sometimes I doze off, that’s the lean, I’m just snoozin’
I still got Actavis, nigga that’s exclusive
Kill you for a pint, that’s a PT Cruiser
I see way too many hoes in my future
I’m gon’ nail all them hoes, I’m Freddy Krueger
Grew up on Bun B, Pimp C was my tutor
Pimp Squad for life, had to do this for Houston
Hollygrove ain’t far from H-Town
We used to drive back and forth with the work
Praying the car don’t break down
Oh, Hollygrove ain’t far from H-Town
We used to drive back and forth with codeine
Cocaine, the pills, and pounds
Yeah, and we got back home safe and sound
If you got pulled over, you don’t give police no names
Or get killed and never found
Word, but I kept some money to bail out
Momma used to say if I ever get caught
They gon’ put me under the jailhouse
Damn, I’m too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
One to the chest with this chopper
Leave you with just arms and a head like a octopus
I got this chopper protecting my livelihood
I’m so good, I’m so straight, I’m secure
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Cut
