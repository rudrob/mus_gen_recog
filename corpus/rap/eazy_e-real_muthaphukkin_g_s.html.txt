Eazy-E:

Hey Yo doctor, here's another proper crack
and it's phat, watch the sniper, time to pay the piper
and let that real shit provoke, so you's a wanna be 'loc
and you'll get smoked and I hope that yer fans understand
when ya talk about sprayin me, the same records that ya 
makin' is payin me
Motherfuck Dre
Motherfuck Snoop
Motherfuck Death Row
Yo, and here comes my left blow
'cuz i'm the E-A-Z-Y-E, and this is the season
to let the Real motherfuckin G's in, ya like a kid ya
found a pup and now yer dapper, but tell me where the
fuck ya found an anorexic rapper
talkin 'bout who ya go squabble with and who ya shoot
you're only 60 pounds when yer wet and wearin boots
damn E, they tried to fade you on Dre Day
But Dre Day only met Eazy's pay day
all of a sudden Dr Dre is a G thang, but on his 
old album cover he was a she thang
so Nigga please, Nigga please don't step to deez
motherfuckin' Real G's


Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am ruthless
Yo Dre, what's up? [bang] Boy you should've known by now
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am ruthless
Yo Dre, what's up? [bang] Boy you should've known by now



Dresta:

Everyday it's a new rapper, claimin to be dapper then
the Dresta, Softer than a bitch but portray the role of gangsta,
ain't broke a law in yer life, yet every time you rap
you rap about the guns and knifes, just take a good look after,
nigga and you'll capture the fact, that the bastard is
simply just an actor, who mastered the bang and the slang
and the mental, of Niggaz in Compton, Wattz, and South Central
never ever once have you ran with the turf, but yet in every verse you
claim you used to do the dirt, but tell me who's a witness
to your fuckin work, so ya never had no buiness, so
save the drama jerk, Niggaz straight kill me
knowin that they pranksters, this is going out to
you studio gangsters, see I did dirt, put in work 
and many Niggaz can vouch that, so since i got stripes
I got the right to rap about that, but Niggaz like you
I gotta hate ya, I'm tired of Suburbian Niggaz talkin about 
they comin from projects
knowin ya ain't seen the parts of the streets G
think ya tryin bang around the time of the peace treaty
wearin khakis and ya mob while ya ryhme, little fag
tried to sag, but you're flooding at the same time,
and ya set don't accecpt ya, so ya scared to kick it with yer homies
'cuz ya know they don't respect ya, So Nigga please check
nuts before ya step to deez, motherfuckin Real G's


B.G Knocc Out

Well, its the Knocc Out, definition orginal baby gangster
approach me like you hard, motherfucker i'mma bank ya
shank ya, with my fuckin shank, if i have to
Dr Dre an Snoop Doggy Dogg are fuckin actors
pranksters, studio gangsters, busters
but this time yer dealin with some real motherfuckers
G's, Nigga please, don't try to step
cause if ya do, then a pealed cap is all that would be left
see, young Niggaz like me, will break ya off somthin,
claimin my city, but Dre you ain't from Compton
Niggaz like ya'll is what i call Wanna be's it aint shit compared
to Real Motherfuckin' G's


Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am ruthless
Yo Dre, what's up? [bang] Boy you should've known by now
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am ruthless
Yo Dre, what's up? [bang] Boy you should've known by now


Eazy-E:

I never met an OG who never did shit wrong
ya tried to dis the Eazy-E so now Nigga it's on you
and your Doggy Dogg, think that y'all hoggin' shit
both of you bitches, can come and suck my Doggy dick
beatin a bitch don't make ya shit, but then again some Niggaz
think it makes a man, Damn it's a trip
how a Nigga could switch so quick from wearin lipstick
to smokin on Chronic at picnics, and now ya think yer bigger
but to me you ain't nothin but a bitch ass Nigga
that ain't worth a food stamp, and at 
Death Row, I hear yer gettin treated like Boot camp
gotta follow yer seargents directions, or get yer ass
pumped with a Smith and Wesson, learn a lesson from the E
Stay in your place and don't step to Real motherfuckin G's


Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am ruthless
Yo Dre, what's up? [bang] Boy you should've known by now
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am ruthless [x4]
Yo Dre, what's up? [bang] Boy ya should have known by now, Eazy duz it....
