[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
First she suck neck, yea then hump back
Me I'm a freak, I get into all that
Girl I perform for you, like a pornostar
Till you had enough then I just need a lil bit more
New music new mood new position
New erotic sounds it's going down now listen
I can hear your heartbeat just sweat and I can paint a perfect picture
I get deep and deeper, I told you I'd getcha
I work that murk that just the way you like it baby
Turn a quickie into a all nighter maybe
Your sex drive it match my sex drive
Then we do movin' this fast it's a nascar ride
Switch gears slow down go down wow now
You can feel every inch of it when we into mail
I use my toungue baby, I leave you sprung maybe
I have your head spining sayin' 50 so crazy

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
I don't play no games, I don't play no games
See when I'm in that thang, when I'm in that thang

Say lil mama put me on, baby put me on
Then I have you gone, then I have you gone
Come see what I mean, see what I mean
See what I mean, see what I mean
Come see what I mean, come see what I mean

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Girl I want you to give me what you got then give me more
Baby you can start on top or on floors
You know I like it when you get into it
Don't nobody do it, uh, like I do it
Feel a rush, feel my touch get intoxicated
Drunk off my love, call a hennessy thug
Passion you laughin' I make you smile on a regular
Tell me what you want shawty that's what I'm a get for ya
Yea I need for ya to be what I need
More than liquor and weed
I need you to maybe give me a seed
I need you to give me a reason to breathe
I need you, I'm tellin' you so now you know what I need

No matter which way it go I'm also gutter
Girl you can get it however you want to get it
I'm feelin' you still I'm telling you right now I'm with it

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
I don't play no games, I don't play no games
See when I'm in that thang, when I'm in that thang

Say lil mama put me on, baby put me on
Then I have you gone, then I have you gone
Come see what I mean, see what I mean

Come see what I mean, come see what I mean

[Outro: 50 Cent]
