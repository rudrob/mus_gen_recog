[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I hope you're proud of me
Dude I grew to be
Ingenuity influenced by your eulogy
Going throught memories
Like they're were movies scenes
I know I've been the shit
All these people fooling me
Are you made of
I'll admit I guess I'm full of myself too
There's just a bunch of shit
I wish i could tell you
This life move's fast, I never knew that
Yours wouldn't have lasted
The dirt hitting your casket, like raindrops
I swear I'll let you know when the pain stops
For now I need to run to to any place the train stops
And everybody wanna talk to me about some business shit
Never really listening, couldn't get real interested
My days get darker, so the haze get sparked up
All this hate, sound the same when my name get brought up
You had a girl, i kinda wish you knocked her up
So i could meet your son and talk you up (Talk you up)

[Hook: Mac Miller]
I remember when we were just kids
We knew nothing at all,
We'd talk about the life we lived
West Virginia, lost somewhere out in
West Virginia

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
It's a dark science, when you're friends start dying
Like how could he go, he was part lion
Life goes on, tears all dryed in
Couple years are gon' by, bye then
Can you please tell me help me find my friend
I'll give you anything you need multiplied by ten
I heard he moved to a place where the time don't end
You don't need money, all you got is time to spend
Life is short, don't ever question the lenghts
It's cool to cry, don't ever question your strength
I recommend no limts, intra- go ahead just give it a shot
You'll remeber shit you've forgot

[Bridge: Mac Miller]
Cus way back then i didn't know shit
And i don't know shit now
And when the whole world is looking hopeless
I'mma still hold shit down

[Hook: Mac Miller]
