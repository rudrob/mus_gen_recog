I've seen a lot of things in my life
Alot of ups and downs
Made alot of mistakes
No matter what, you've always been by my side
You've always been my best friend
You're the love of my life (oh)
You're everything to me (oh)
You never left my side (you're my best friend)
I love you so much (yes, you are)
You're my best friend

[puffy]
Since the beginning of time
All you did was bless men
Too young to understand but now you my best friend
How could they doubt you, never think about you
Don't they know nothing's possible without you

Faith without fear that's how they raised me
Words of man kill but never phase me
Grateful for wisdom that you gave me
But still i'm like, dear god i wonder, could you save me?
Too much sinning, gotta be more than plush living
Gotta be more than grabbing nines to buck tin in
Gotta be more than just to lust women
Gotta be more than platinum rolexes, 600's and crushed linen
Praise your name, i know some of them hate their due
Judgment day, don't they know they can't escape your crew
I'm just trying to live right and pray you take me through
And with this song i dedicate to you, my lord

1 - [mario winans]
Lord, you mean the world to me
Before i was born you chose me
You always hear me when i'm calling
Even catch me when i'm falling
You're the closest one to me
I surrender all to thee
I want the whole wide world to see
That we've always been and we'll always be
Best friends

[puffy]
Sometimes i reminisce and wonder how i made it this far
Because of you, i'm me, so you the real star
Your hindsight, the time's right to get my mind tight
Then give it to you and let it shine bright
My best friend, only know how to teach the truth
Plant the seeds of life and let them eat the fruit
Can't you see that he spread love for you
Shed blood for you, cry for and die for you
Willies with mac millies know how you get down
We know the drama you bring whenever you hit town
Just remember when you pray, god is love
Gracious, merciful, forgive even the hardest thugs
Life as we know it, it all begins with him
Life as we know it, it all ends with him
If i was you i would never try to pretend with him
He might spaz and blow it, i'm best friends with him

Repeat 1

[puffy]
Been two and a half years since my man big passed
Been two and a half years since my world crashed
I needed help, god gave me the power
Gave me the strength to go face to face with my darkest hour
Looked me in the eyes and ask "what you doing unhappy?"
"don't you know why i'm here?" and started shooting at me
Back to the wall, is my faith gonna play out
Never wavered once, gave me no way out
Your time to die, don't even stress the date
You're coming with me, your soul i'm next to take
I told him "i'm too much blessed with faith"
"and living for christ" and then he said "manifest the great"
All of a sudden, what i'm remembering
Ground started to shake, everything trembling
The power of the truth was shooting through my timberlands
Here was my lord jesus christ, my best friend again, come on

Repeat 1 while:

[puffy]
You mean everything to me
You've been with me from day one
Even when i thought nobody was there
You were there
You're my best friend
I love you like no other
There is no feeling like this in the world
If you can relate to what i'm feeling
Put your hands in the air for me
Let me see you
Naw, matter of fact clap your hands for me
Clap your hands, come on
Thank you jesus
You always hear me when i'm calling
Always catch me when i fall, yeah
I surrender all to thee
I want the whole world to see
That you've always been, you'll always be
My best friend
I love you jesus
Thank you, forgive me for my trespasses
As i forgive those who trespass against me
Thank you
