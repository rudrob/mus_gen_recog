[Intro: T-Pain]
Dear Akon... forgive me for what I'm about to say...
Dear Barry Wize I know you told me not to worry about it man but I can't let it ride...
Dear God... let's make it happen
(ha ha ha) ha ha I'm tryin to be you niggas...
Ha yeah you niggas
Watch me do me, watch me do me, watch me do me, watch me do me hey! (nappy boy)
Nappy boy

[DJ Khaled:]
Dj khaled!
Aye yo Pain
I want you to go in

[T-Pain:]
Hey yo Khaled let's go man (we the best) hey hey hey (listenn)
I got up out da streets so I ain't gotta steal
But listen to the radio it's obvious I still kill
When ya'll was in the game
Way before me
So why you wanna do some shit I did in '03
I'm layin low key (yeah)
For a long time
But don't act like you know me
This is the wrong time
So grab ya microphone
Set yo auto tune
And I'm a bust a verse on yo ass like I outta do
I ain't no gangsta dude
Ain't got a poppin banga
But you know I'm powerful when I'm pissin off the gospel singas
I'm tryin to feed my kids
Y'all niggas can die slowly
Cause to me it sound like a bunch of karaoke

[DJ Khaled:]
Aye yo fuck the imposta
Fuck these karaoke niggas
Aye yo pain dey tryin to live your life man
These some bitch ass niggas man
It's the dj khaled
Nappy boy
I'm goin in
I'm goin in
Aye yo T-pain

[T-Pain:]
I know you khaled I know you right now
But uh let me get em' again
Aye aye uh listen it ain't all bad
Some of it please me
But the only niggas that cool is Kanye and Lil Weezy
I'm a hit maker
Not a comedian
So why da fuck were these niggas laughin at me when I seen they ass
This shit would never work
A one hit wonder bitch
But all that shit that you doing now make me wonder this
Now why it's cool for you
But it's not for me
And why he ain't hop on my song and make it hot for me
But u don't give a fuck
You just a swagger jacker
Now I'm a certifed lamborghinist and cadillacer
Cause I'm tryna feed my kids
Y'all niggas could die slowly
Cause just to me
It sound like a bunch of karaoke

[DJ Khaled:]
Y'all singin da same ol song
Y'all some karaoke niggas
Karaoke fuck niggas
This is nappy boy
This is dj khaled
We global with this hood shit
This what we do
Why you wanna live our life
You wanna live our lifestyles
Aye yo t-pain

[T-Pain:]
Waddup Khaled (Get Them)
Let me get a moment of silence
For the late great Roger Troutman
Ya'll niggas ain't holding it down
So we had to put me at ya
Bitch I'm Teddy Pain
The son of Teddy Riley
The father of the game
You bustin niggas wildin
How many niggas really wanna test
Pain nigga riggen gotta be da best
Only muthafuckas tryna do what I did stealin food from an infant sty from a kid
24 years
24 cars
Bitch we da best we done been in most stalls
Everytime you pussy muthafuckas try to stop me
It's plenty more hits
Plenty more balls
Yeeeeahh dats not cool baby (baby)
So dats not haappenning (ning)
Ya'll keep on stealing from me (from me)
Let me try this rapping thang (thang)
I know you know I hear ya (hear ya)
And it ain't embarassing (sing)
Set the game on fire (fine)
Teddy got some meeeeaaaannn
Pussy niggas step up if you really got good game
I got a lot of niggas sayin about da nigga
But it's really not good things
Dat ain't no disrespect man ya'll keep doin ya shit
But my daughter told me to tell you to get off her daddy's dick

[Dj Khaled:]
