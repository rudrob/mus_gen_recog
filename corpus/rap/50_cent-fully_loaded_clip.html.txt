                    High spit Ferrari movement
Third lanes swiching lanes, what up
Brooklyn, what up,
Fourwrap, what up,

Jay and Beyonce was hmm hmm kissing
I was cookin' one thousand grams in my kitchen
Nas just tellin' Kelis I love you boo
I was shinin' my nine, you know how I do
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on that shit
I got, I got a fully loaded clip
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on that shit (yeah)
I got, I got a fully loaded clip

Who want problem with me, no problem it's all good
I'm fresh out the hood, I'm still in the hood
Black rims, black Hemi, nigga see me when you see me
I appear and desappear with the eater like Houdini
The party with bullshit, you get you ass pop
Don't believe me, ask Fab he got his head shot
I'm in the cut like turns, I do dirt like Burms
Smoke weed, now I'm sure, nigga it's my turn
I fire on your ass then hollow tips burn, baby burn
I scream fuck the cops, ride around with my glock
Test my pistol on my bitch, nigga fuck that box
Thats how P got knocked, that's how jeweler drop
But Dre beat that nigga, go ahead repeat that nigga
You might learn a lil' something if you learn to stop frontin'
My nigga look easy on three P's B-P's rollin' lockin'
I'm really with the dope man

When Janet and Jermaine was hmm hmm kissing
I was baggin' one thousand grams in my kitchen
Puffy just tellin' Kim, I love you boo
I was shining my nine, you know how I do
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on that shit
I got, I got a fully loaded clip
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on that shit (yeah)
I got, I got a fully loaded clip

Have the dice game, and better all hear when I'm saying
Take gram I fall better, nigga I ain't playing
I trying to get it, holla at me if you with it
The lace up at the top cuz we can fuck, muhfuckers
My stomach is grilling, you say that I'm walling
I'm doing my numbers, I ain't getting violent
You hear me rap and think that I'm playing
Then see the bower and then see the flame
I need full cooperation man give us the chain
The watch, the ring and the grill be playing
I fire that thing and it sound the same
Holla I got that news candyman

When Jeezy and Keysha was hmm hmm kissing
I was bagging one thousand grams in my kitchen
And Trina was telling Wayne, I love you boo
She was running games, she told Buck that too
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on that shit
I got, I got a fully loaded clip
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on that shit (yeah)
I got, I got a fully loaded clip
