Young Money
Ya dig
Yea, Mack I'm on it.

[Zwrotka 1:]
A Millionaire,
I'm a Young Money Millionaire, tougher than Nigerian hair,
My criteria compared to your career this isn't fair,
I'm a venereal disease like a menstrual bleed...
Through the pencil and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind,
Cause I don't write shit cause I ain't got time,
Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the all mighty dollar,
And the all mighty power of that cha cha cha chopper,
Sister, Brother, Son, Daughter, Father motha f**k a copper,
Got da maserati dancin on the bridge pussy poppin,
Tell the coppers... hahahaha you can't catch em, you can't stop em,
I go by them goon rules if you can't beat em then you pop em,
You can't man em then you mop em,
You can't stand em then you drop em,
You pop em cause we pop em like Orville Redenbacher,

[Zwrotka 2:]
A milli in here a milli in there
Sicilian bitch with long hair
with coconut Derierre
Like smokin the thinest air I open the Lamborghini
Hopin them crackers see like look at dat bastard Weezy
Hes a beast, hes a dog, hes the muthfukin problem
Ok your a goon but what's a goon to a goblin
Nothin nothin you ain't scarin nothin
On some faggot bullshit call em dennis rodman
Call me what you want bitch call me on my Sidekick
Never answer when it's private damn I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch yea I ate a shy bitch
And she ain't shy nomore she changed her name to my bitch
Yea nigga that's my bitch so when she ask for the Money when you through don't be surprised, bitch
It ain't trickin if u got it
But u like a bitch with no ass, u ain't got shit
Muthafuka I'm Ill, not sick
And I'm ok, but my watch sick
Yea my drop sick
Yea my glock sick
And my knot thick
I'm it

Muthafuka I'm I'll...

[Zwrotka 3:]
They say I'm rappin like BIG jay, and tupac,
Andre 3000 where is erika badu at
Who dat
Who dat said dey gon beat lil wayne
My name ain't Bic but I keep dat flame man
Who that wanna do dat boy ya knew dat you da Swallow
And I be da shit now u got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for u to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushing flowers
Then to be in the pen sharing showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us if the girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy I got so many bitches like I'm Mike Lowry
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Muthafuka I say life ain't shit without me
Chrome lips pokin out the coupe like it's poutin
I do what I do and u do what u can do about it
Bitch I can turn a crack rock into a mountain
Damn dat
Don't u compare me cause there ain't noody near me They don't see but they hear me
They don't feel me but they feel me I'm Ill-e
