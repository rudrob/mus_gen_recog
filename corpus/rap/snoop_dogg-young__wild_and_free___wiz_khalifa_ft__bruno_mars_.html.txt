                    [Chorus]
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out
That’s how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, Uh huh
So what I keep ‘em rolled up
Saggin’ my pants not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for the hoes
And look clean don’t it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501’s jeans on and roll joints bigger than King Kong’s fingers
And smoke them hoes down ’till they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day I’m with you bitch smokin’ grade A

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, uh you know what?
It’s like I’m 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin’, on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh My God, I’m on the chase
Chevy, its gettin’ kinda heavy, relevant, sellin’ it
Dippin’ away, time keep slippin’ away
Zip in the safe, flippin’ for pay
Tippin’ like I’m drippin’ in paint
Up front four blunts, like “Khalifa put the weed in a J”

[Snoop Dogg]
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out
That’s how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, and now I don't even care
Long as me and my team in here
There's gon' be some weed in the air
Tell 'em Mac-

[Snoop Dogg]
Blowin' everywhere we goin'
And now ya knowin'
When I step right up
Get my lighter so I can light up

[Wiz Khalifa]
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are looking up

[Snoop Dogg]
From the ground up
Pound up
It's Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up
And mount up
And do my thang

[Wiz Khalifa]
Now I'm chillin
Fresh outta class feelin'
Like I'm on my own
And I could probably own a building
Got my own car
No job - no children
Had this science project
Me and Mac killed it

[Snoop Dogg]
T-H-C
M-A-C
D-E-V
H-D-3
High as me
This is us
We gon' fuss
And we gon' fight
And we gon' roll
And live off life

[Bruno Mars]
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Wiz Khalifa]
Yea, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So we just, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun

[ All - Chorus]
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out
That's how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Wiz Khalifa]
So what
We get drunk
So what we smoke weed
Were just having
Funnn
And we don't care who seee [Snoop Dogg](we don't care who sees)
So what we go out
That's how it's supposed to beee
Livin' young , and wild , and free
