im not saying this to shake you up
im just saying this to wake you up
its all good when we making love
all i ask is dont take our love
for granted, its granted
my love for you, is real
baby if you dont love me
somebody else will, so baby girl
dont you ever get too comfortable


Lil Wayne // Verse 1
yeah to the left to the left
if you wanna leave be my guest, you can step
feeling irreplacable listen to beyonce
but ok ill put you out on your bday
now if you rocking with weezay
bedroom in the bank, baby we safe
i got game like E.A.
but i wanna let you play
and dont i treat you like suflai
dont i look at you like a i see a new day
and dont i do ,what i do say
im threw talking so imma let you, face


BabyFace // Hook
im not saying this to (and let yay do yay) shake you up
im just saying this to wake you up
its all good when we making love
all i ask is dont take our love
for granted, its granted
my love for you, is real
if you dont love me
somebody else will, so baby girl
dont you ever get too comfortable


Lil Wayne // Verse 2
yeah let me catch my breath
you talking bout leave baby you aint gone yet
and if you leave, leave correct
and imma send a jet to pick up the next
and if you leave, your leaving the best
so you would have to settle for less

Lil Wayne // Verse 3
yeah, it's no sweat no sweat
i will never 1, 2, 3 4-get
about you, your love, your sex
you know i work you out like bowflex
our jokes. no stress. love.
live life. proceed. progress.
make sure the neighbors get no rest
we can get together, never disconnect
your back, your neck
funny how that song hasen't got old yet - to us.
so let's project, you stay in
never in - correkt
FACE!

for granted, its granted
my love for you, is real
if you dont love me
somebody else will, so baby girl
dont you ever get too comfortable
