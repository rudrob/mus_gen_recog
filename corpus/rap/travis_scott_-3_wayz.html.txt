                    [Intro]
Ya, lean, lean, on me
Yeah, yeah, codeine
Yeah, yeah, codeine
Yeah, yeah, codeine
Yeah, yeah

[Hook]
One more stop 'for the world stop
We gon' roll this loud it's prohibited
Making money moves off the laptop
Codeine, codeine, codeine
No prescriptions here

[Post-Hook]
It's okay, it's okay, it's alright
We gon' go, we gon' do what you like yeah
But we like to party on a weekday
And everything I do I do it three ways
Case you didn't know
Case you didn't know
We like to party on a weekday
And everything I do, I do it three ways

[Verse 1]
No, case you didn't know
Take a shot of Hennessy it's down your throat
That lean, lean, lean, lean, lean
Me turned into a freak
Bodies all gotta bleed
Bodies all got to bleed
Bodies all Mr. Clean
Slowly rolling in a feeling
Me turned into a freak
Bodies all gotta bleed
Bodies all got to bleed
Bodies all Mr. Clean
Case you didn't know, case you didn't know
Case you didn't know
We like to party on a weekday
And everything I do I do it three ways

[Hook]
One more stop till the world stop
We gon' roll this loud it's prohibited
Making money moves of the laptop
Codeine, codeine, codeine
No prescriptions here

[Post-Hook]
It's okay, it's okay, it's alright
We gon' go, we gon' do what you like yeah
But we like to party on a weekday
And everything I do I do it three ways
Case you didn't know, case you didn't know
Case you didn't know
We like to party on a weekday
And everything I do I do it three ways

[Verse 2]
Bodies all bleed, bodies all bleed
Bodies all bleed, bodies all bleed
Bodies all bleed, bodies all bleed
Guiding my team it's solving some things
What happened to me, what's gotten into me?
We hit Jay and leave share my Hennessy
I just fell for you and found you in my dreams
But to me, but to me yeah
