Look at these niggaz with attitudes
Look at these niggaz with attitudes
Look at these niggaz with attitudes, hello

I started this gangsta shit
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get, hello
I started this gangsta shit
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get, hello

The motherfuckin' world is a ghetto
Full of magazines, full clips, and heavy metal
When the smoke settle
I'm just lookin' for a big yellow in six inch stilletos

Dr. Dre, hello, perculatin' keep 'em waitin'
While you sittin' here hatin', yo' bitch is hyperventilatin'
Hopin' that we penetratin', you gets natin'
'Cause, I never been to Satan, for hardcore administratin'

Gang bang affiliatin', MC Ren'll have you
Wildin' off a zone and a whole half a gallon
Get to dialin' 9 1 1 emergency
And you can tell 'em, it's my son, he's hurtin' me
And he's a felon on parole for robbery

Ain't no coppin' a plea, ain't no stoppin' a G
I'm in the 6, you got to hop in the 3, company monopoly
You handle shit sloppily, I drop a ki properly

They call me the Don Dada, pop a collar
Drop a dollar if you hear me, you can holla
Even rottweilers, follow, the Impala
Wanna talk about this concrete? Nigga, I'm a scholar

The incredible, hetero sexual, credible
Beg a hoe, let it go, dick ain't edible
Nigga ain't federal, I plan shit
While you hand picked motherfuckers givin' up transcripts

Look at these niggaz with attitudes
Look at these niggaz with attitudes, hello

I started this gangsta shit
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get, hello
I started this gangsta shit
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get

Villain blows up yo' spot
Take yo' notebook, yo' bitch and yo' glock
This motherfucker thought the coochie had a padlock
You slapped her ass, that's alarmin'
'Cause she want my worm like Carmen

We chin check niggaz, them thin check niggaz
Run trains on golddiggers, beware these fo' niggaz
Scarin' motherfuckers like Steven King flicks
Makin' niggaz clear the room like a Dyke flea a dick
Makin' 2nd to none, shit, nigga like quick
So when I bomb first, nigga, who you rollin' with?

Fuck that ice on your wrist, fuck yo' fine ass bitch
'Cause you could lose it in a tussle, nigga, watch me hustle
Watch niggaz kiss my ass without flexin' a muscle
Bitches, all in the back, they knees waitin' to buckle
Same time, same channel, don't change the dial
Niggaz 4 Life, fuckin' your wife, these niggaz wild, hello

I started this gangsta shit
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get, hello
I started this gangsta shit
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get, hello

Did I fall off? Got you in your room
Rippin' every chronic poster on your wall off
Just 'cause I put away the sawed off
Now I got you sittin' back with a smirk
Listenin' with your arms crossed

Questionin' Dre's credibility
Wondering if it's still in me to produce hits, y'all be killin' me
As if I need to make mo', I got a mansion
And six cars that are paid fo', suck my dick, hello

We came a long way from not givin' a fuck
Sellin' tapes out of a trunk to movin' this far up
Now we got the whole world starstruck
Made a million plus and still don't give a motherfuck

Motherfucker, I'm Dre, I don't need your respect
I don't need to make another album, bitch, I don't gotta do shit
I do it because I want to not to stay in the game
Fuck the fame, I'm still stayin' the same, lil' bitch, hello

I started this gangsta shit
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get, hello
I started this gangsta shit
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get, hello

Look at these niggaz with attitudes
