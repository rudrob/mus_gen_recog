                    Arf arf
Yeah (uh), yeah, yeah (uh) (Grrrr)
Yeah, don't get it twisted
This rap shit is mine, motherfucker!
It's not a fucking game
Fuck what you heard!
It’s what you hearin' (it’s what you hearin')
It’s what you hearin' (listen!)
It’s what you hearin' (listen!)
It’s what you hearin' (listen!)

[Verse 1]
X gon' give it to ya
Fuck waiting for you to get it on your own, X gon' deliver to ya
Knock knock, open up the door, it's real
With the non-stop, pop pop of stainless steel
Go hard, getting busy wit it
But I got such a good heart
That I'll make a motherfucker wonder if he did it
Damn right, and I'll do it again, cause I am right so I gots to win
Break bread with the enemy, but no matter how many cats I break bread with I'll break who you sendin' me
You motherfuckers never wanted nothing
But your life saved, bitch, and that's on a light day
I'm getting down, down like a nigga said "Freeze!"
But won't be the one ending up on his knees
Bitch please, if the only thing you cats did
Was came out to play, stay out my way, motherfucker!

[Chorus: DMX]
First we gonna ROCK, Then we gonna ROLL
Then we let it POP, GO LET IT GO
X gon give it to ya
He gon give it to ya
X gon give it to ya
He gon give it to ya
[Repeat Once]

[Verse 2]
Ain't never gave nothin to me
But everytime I turn around
Cats got they hands out wantin something from me
I ain't got it so you can't get it
Lets leave it at that cuz I ain't wit it
Hit it wit full strength
I'm a jail nigga
So I face the world like it's Earl in the bullpen
You against me, me against you
Whatever, whenever
What the fuck you gon do?
I'm a wolf in sheep clothing
Only nigga that you know that can chill
Come back and get the streets open
I've been doing this for nineteen years
Niggas wanna fight me? Fight these tears
I put in work and it's all for the kids
But these cats done forgot what work is (UH-HUH!)
They don't know who we be
Lookin! but they don't know who they see, nigga

[Chorus: DMX]
First we gonna ROCK, Then we gonna ROLL
Then we let it POP, GO LET IT GO
X gon give it to ya
He gon give it to ya
X gon give it to ya
He gon give it to ya
[Repeat Once]

[Verse 3]
Aiiyo where my niggaz at?!
I know I got them down in the game
Give em love and they give it back
Talk too much for too long
Don't give up you're to strong (What?!)
A dog to bow bow hug it
Shoutout to niggaz that done it
And it ain't even about the dough
It's about gettin down for what you stand for yo (for real)

[Chorus: DMX]
First we gonna ROCK, Then we gonna ROLL
Then we let it POP, GO LET IT GO
X gon give it to ya
He gon give it to ya
X gon give it to ya
He gon give it to ya
[Repeat Twice]
