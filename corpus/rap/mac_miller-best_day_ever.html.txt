                    I never take a day off
Work around the clock my engineer getting paid off
Rock like Aesop
Light the weed and take off
So high I cannot see, Adolf
Now I got these rappers all breaking up in sweat
Cause every time I get up on the mic it come correct
And I learned it from the best
Always dressed in something fresh
Looking for a little dime, big butt and nice chest, yes
They heard I used to rock guess
But now I’m rocking clothes that ain’t in the stores yet
Travel back in time, I’m in a vortex
Trying to make it work out I think I need more reps
Used to take the bus now the boy boy jets
Cause k.i.d.s. got me buzzing like a fucking hornet
They say I got next
Tell them that I got now
It’s all Disney boy, my family proud
Make ‘em say ‘ow’, make ‘em say ‘oh’
The hoes that tell me ‘yes’, the same ones that tell you ‘no’, whoa
I ain’t just an average Joe
Way above the average flow
Boy, my life is most dope

No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Presumed to be happy always laughing like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin’ from cheek to cheek
Ay, ay
And I ain’t going to wait for nothing
Cause that just ain’t my style
Life couldn’t get better
This ‘gone be the best day ever

If it ain’t about a dream, then it ain’t about me
Gone a couple weeks without a fulls night sleep
Imagination, making, musical creation
The journey that I’m facing
Plus the paper that I’m chasing
Got me crazy acting insane
With the lames I see you hating
But there’s nothing that you’re changing
Thumbs up, I’m maintaining
No complaining when it’s raining
I be in another zone
Move out my mother’s home
To a world I call my own
I ain’t gonna play around no more
Found a difference from the ground and the floor
If we got a fight, I’ll be down for the war
Thumbs up homie I’ll be sure

No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Presumed to be happy always laughing like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin’ from cheek to cheek
Ay, ay
And I ain’t going to wait for nothing
Cause that just ain’t my style
Life couldn’t get better
This ‘gone be the best day ever
