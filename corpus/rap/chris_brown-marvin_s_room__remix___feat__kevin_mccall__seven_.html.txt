                    Oh, oohh, yeah yeah
This right here for my niggas that been hated on
This shit right here, shit right here
This right here

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
He's saying he's your bestfriend
And he's the one always in your ear
I know that he been waiting
To get my ass up out of here
It's been a couple months now
And baby I am not surprised
But I'm a real nigga
Girl how you gon take his side

[Hook:]
I bet if I lick that spot then you won't act like that
I miss giving you them backshots
Girl you remember that (remember that)
Baby, and I'd be damned if I let him take my place
Don't listen what that niggas say

[Chorus:]
Cause, he's just saying you can do better
And baby all I'm saying is he sound like a hater
And baby he can just fuck off and do us a favor
Mind your business
Nigga stop being a hater

[Bridge: Seven]
Here we go
Why these niggas keep hating for
Guess that's just the way it goes oh, oh
Just the way it goes oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Baby what the hell are you thinking
By the way your screaming at me thinking you been drinking
I know that nigga's on your line
But he can't get what's mine, yeah
Baby you need to show me what the hell I did wrong
I need you to hold me right here in your arms
And I'm kissing your heart and all your little body parts
Oh, baby, baby

[Hook:]
I bet if I lick that spot then you won't act like that
I miss giving you them backshots
Girl you rememeber that (remember that)
Baby, and I'd be damned if I let him take my place
Don't listen to what that niggas say (don't listen what them niggas say)

[Chorus:]
Cause, He's just saying you can do better (no he can't, I know he can't)
And baby all I'm saying is he sound like a hater (just keep hating)
And baby he can just fuck off and do us a favor
Mind your business
Nigga stop being a hater

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall]
K Mac
See it's a reason why she still with me and she ain't with you
She see the real in me and a bitch in you
Yeah she friends with you and but she sexing me
When she be texting you, she be next to me
Showing me how weak you is, it's embarrassing
I'm a real nigga, so I guess you are a mannequin
Bad on the phone but in person you be panicking
I ain't even stressed, gotta bag full of cannibis
I ain't with the bull, so this ain't beef
You're a weenie, I bet you be lying on your meat
If real recognize real, who the fuck is you
She need a principal, not a substitute

[Outro: Kevin McCall & Chris Brown]
Oohh yeah, yeah
He just saying you can do better (no he can't girl)
Girl stop playing and you know that he could never, never
Be the one you need to show that you're the one for me, girl
I know how to please you right, yeah, yeah, yeah, oohh
He just saying you can do better, baby, baby
Girl stop playing and you know that he could never, oohh
Be the one you need to show that you're the one for me
But I'm a real nigga
Yeah, yeah, yeahhh
