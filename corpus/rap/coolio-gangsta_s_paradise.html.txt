                    [Verse 1] 
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's not much left 
Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long, that
Even my momma thinks that my mind is gone,
But I never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of 
You better watch how ya talkin' and where ya walkin' 
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk 
I really hate to trip but I gotta loc',
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke,
Fool, I'm the kinda G that little homies wanna be like,
On my knees in the night sayin' prayers in the street light

Been spending most our lives Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives Livin' in a gangsta's paradise 
We keep spending most our lives Livin' in a gangsta's paradise 
We keep spending most our lives Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

[Verse 2] 
Look at the situation, they got me facing 
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street 
So I gotta be down with the 'hood team 
Too much television watching got me chasing dreams
I'm an educated fool with money on my mind 
Got MAC-10 in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set tripping banger 
And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger 
Fool, death ain't nothing but a heart beat away 
I'm living life do or die, what can I say
I'm twenty-three now, but will I live to see twenty-four
The way things is going I don't know

[Refrain] 
Tell me why are we 
So blind to see 
That the ones we hurt 
Are you and me 
Been spending most their lives Living in a gangsta's paradise 
Been spending most their lives Living in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives Living in a gangsta's paradise 
We keep spending most our lives Living in a gangsta's paradise

[Verse 3] 
Power in the money, money in the power 
Minute after minute, hour after hour 
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't looking
What's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin' 
They say I gotta learn 
But nobody's here to teach me 
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me? 
I guess they can't I guess they won't I guess they front 
That's why I know my life is out of luck, fool!

[Refrain] 
Been spending most their lives Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives Livin' in a gangsta's paradise 
We keep spending most our lives Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spending most our lives Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

Tell me why are we 
So blind to see 
That the ones we hurt
Are you and me 
Tell me why are we 
So blind to see 
That the ones we hurt 
Are you and me
