                    Chorus
Suddenly I see some niggas that I don't like [Ice Cube]
Got him [Dr. Dre]

[Verse one: 2PAC]
A smoking ass nigga robbed me blind
I got a tech nine now his smoking ass is mine
I guess I felt sorry for the bastard, he was broke
I didn't know he smoked so I didn't watch him close
He caught me on the sneak tip, now the punk's in deep shit
Catch him on the streets, I'ma bring him to his feet, quick
Pass the clip, I think I see him coming now
Fuck the bullshit, posse deep and let's run him down
Gots to be the first one to hit you when we meet
Coming quickly up the streets, is the punk ass police
The first one jumped out and said, "Freeze"
I popped him in his knees and I shouted, Punk Please!
'Cause cops, 'll mind they business, when we rush
Now you're bleeding like a bitch, 'cause you don't know how to, hush
Now back to the smoker that robbed me
I tell you like Latifah, motherfucker give me, body
One to the chest, another to his fucking dome
Now the shit can rest, yo, tell em to leave me the fuck alone
Two very bloody bodies on the street
A nosey ass cop and a nigga that robbed from me
Run from your backup punk, how you figure?
My finger's on the trigger for you crooked ass niggas

[Chorus]
Crooked ass niggas
Criminal behaviour, criminal, criminal behaviour [Eazy-E]
Suddenly I see [Ice Cube]
Criminal [Eazy-E]

[Verse two: Stretch]
Now listen to the mack of the crooked nigga trade
With the fine criminal mind, cold rips like a blade
It's a raid quick steppin to the niggas with the props
And any motherfucker with the flim flam drops to the knot
Ten o'clock, is a motherfuckin gank move
Stretch is uptown, clocking weight the shit is real smooth
A nigga's tryin to play me like he know me but he don't
Sitting on ten keys, I'ma get him, think I won't?
With my nigga Tupac, got the fuckin glock cocked, and he's ready
When the kid, didn't even bring the weight bag, instead he
Welcomed us, into his apartment
Oh, this even better, two to the head, he's dead a clean get-a-way
Niggas got paid
And yup, another sleeping ass nigga got slayed, word up
By a crooked motherfucker named Stretch
And the T-U-P-A-C, the police can't catch

[Chorus]
The crooked ass niggas
Criminal behaviour (Eazy)
Yeah, ya don't stop
Crooked ass niggas
Criminal, criminal behaviour (Eazy)
Suddenly I see, some niggas that I don't like (Cube)

[Verse three: 2PAC]
Now I could be a crooked nigga too
When I'm rolling with my crew, watch what crooked niggas, do
I got a nine millimeter glock pistol
I'm ready to get with cha at the drop, of a whistle
So make your move, and act like you wanna flip
I fire thirteen shots, and popped another clip
I bring luck, my glock's like a fucking mop
The more I shot, the more motherfuckers dropped
And even cops got shot when they rolled up
Best to bring a knot, or get popped, I'm a soldier
I ain't the type to flex, ask Stretch, he's my witness
Smoke till I'm blitzed, fuck a motherfucking piss test
I'm trigger happy, try to jack me and I'll drop you quick
Long as I've got a clip I got some shit to hit 'em with
The nigga killer I get iller when the shit gets thick
My brain flips, starts all thinking like a lunatic
I rip shit, came equipped with a bigger crew
I thought these niggas knew, I'm a crooked nigga too

[Chorus]
Criminal behaviour, criminal, criminal behaviour

[Verse four: 2PAC]
Crooked
Crooked ass niggas come in all shapes and sizes
They wear disguises, backstabbings what they specialize in
They'll try to get cha, they'll sweat cha to get in the picture
And then they hit cha, son of a bitch, now he's richer
Crooked ass nigga

[Chorus]
Criminal behaviour, criminal, criminal behaviour
Suddenly I see, some niggas that I don't like
Criminal behaviour
Criminal, criminal
Criminal behaviour
Criminal behaviour, criminal behaviour
Suddenly I see, some niggas that I don't like
Suddenly I see, some niggas that I don't like
Suddenly I see, some niggas that I don't like
Criminal behaviour
Criminal, criminal
Criminal behaviour
Criminal
Criminal behaviour
Criminal behaviour
Suddenly I see, some niggas that I don't like
Got him
Suddenly I see, some niggaz that I don't like
Got him
Suddenly I see, some niggaz that I don't like
Got him
