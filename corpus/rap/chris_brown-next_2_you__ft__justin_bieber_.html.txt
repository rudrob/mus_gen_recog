                    [Chris Brown]
You’ve got that smile,
That only heaven can make.
I pray to God everyday,
That you keep that smile. (Yeah)

[Justin Bieber]
You are my dream, (you are my dream)
There’s not a thing I won’t do.
I’ll give my life up for you,
'Cause you are my dream.

[Chris Brown & Justin Bieber]
And baby, everything that I have is yours,
You will never go cold or hungry.
I’ll be there when you’re insecure,
Let you know that you’re always lovely.
Girl, 'cause you are the only thing that I got right now

[Chris Brown]
One day when the sky is falling,
I’ll be standing right next to you,
Right next to you.
Nothing will ever come between us,
'Cause I’ll be standing right next to you,
Right next to you.

[Chris Brown]
You had my child,
You would make my life complete.
Just to have your eyes on little me,

[Justin Bieber]
That’d be mine forever.

[Chris Brown & Justin Bieber]
And baby, everything that I have is yours
You will never go cold or hungry
I’ll be there when you’re insecure
Let you know that you’re always lovely
Girl, 'cause you are the only thing that I got right now

One day when the sky is falling,
I’ll be standing right next to you,
Right next to you. (uuuu)
Nothing will ever come between us,
I’ll be standing right next to you,
Right next to you.

[Chris Brown]
We’re made for one another
Me and you

[Justin Bieber]
And I have no fear
I know we’ll make it through

[Chris Brown]
One day when the sky is falling
I’ll be standing right next to you
Ohh ohh ohh ohhhhh

[Chris Brown & Justin Bieber]
One day when the sky is falling (when sky is falling)
I’ll be standing right next to you (right next to you)
Right next to you (right next to you)
Nothing will ever come between us,
I’ll be standing right next to you,
Right next to you.

Oh nah nah
Oh yeah
Stand by my side, side, side
When the sky falls
I"ll be there
I’ll be there

You’ve got that smile,
That only heaven can make.
I pray to God everyday,
To keep you forever.
(oooooooch)
