Can you feel me 
Do that shit do that shit do it 
Do that shit do that shit do it 
Do that shit do that shit do it 
Do that shit do that shit do it 
ooh yeah 
On the dance floor 
Yeah yeah yeah 
Lets play a game 
On the dance floor 
(Oh yeah) 
Yeah yeah yeah 

Let's play a game 
Let's pretend for a second 
You don't know who I am or what I do 
Let's just put it to the side 
I can feel your heart beating 
I can hear you breathing 
Look into your eyes 
Trying to see into your mind 
See into your soul 
See, no limits to the levels 
Me and you can go 
When it's me, I take control 
But it's something about you 
That makes me wanna change 
I like the way you dancing 
And the way you play the game 
I like the way you take away the pain 
The way you tell me that you want it 
Not saying a thing 
The way you got me going 
Got me going outta brains 
I see us going at it 
Going in and out of them lanes 

I don't want your innocence 
I don't want you to stutter 
I don't want a commitment 
I don't want you to suffer 
I don't want your number 
Baby, I want you to wonder 
I want you to come up 
Looking like something you wanna 

[Christina Aguilera:] 
Tell me, what you thinking about 
When you got me waitng patiently 
And usually, I don't have to wait for nobody 
But there's something about you 
That really got me feeling weak 
And I'm trying to find the words to speak 

Boy, I got my eyes on you 
Tell me what you wanna do 
I can picture you in my room 
Until the morning 
I don't even know your name 
Boy, I need to know your name 
I'm hoping that you feel the same 
Tell me if you want it 

I know you're gonna like it (I know) 
So tell me how you want it (Tell me) 
And you don't have to fight it (You don't) 
Cause baby you're invited (Baby) 
I know you're gonna like it (I know) 
So tell me how you want it (Tell me) 
And you don't have to fight it (You don't) 
Cause baby you're invited (Baby) 

[Diddy:] 
You're dreams fullfilled 
You're rockin with the best 
- put your limits to the test 
You're pulsating, your heart is beating outta your chest 
You're hyperventilating, trying to catch your breath 
(Don't stop) 
I'm the first, I'm the next, I'm the end 
I'm the boss, in your thoughts, that'll make your mind bend 
Look how I approach you, look how I expose you 
The - every move, now I know you 
I don't wanna control you, I wanna console you 
And do everything that I told you 
Get high with me, come touch the sky with me 
Fly with me, see life with new eyes with me 
(Don't stop) 
I'm the dream, I'm the one, I'm the reason you come 
I'm a king, I'm a hung, I'm a beast 
I'm the last thing your eyes see 
The passion's inside me, it's yours 
Now come try me, c'mon 

[Christina Aguilera:] 
Tell me, what you thinking about 
When your hands is all on me 
Cause I've been thinking about 
All the possibilities 
Ain't no other place that I really wanna be 
Cause you're sweepin' me off my feet 

Boy, I got my eyes on you 
Tell me what you wanna do 
I can picture you in my room 
Until the morning 
I don't even know your name 
Boy, I need to know your name 
I'm hoping that you feel the same 
Tell me if you want it 

[Hook:] 
I know you're gonna like it (I know) 
So tell me how you want it (Tell me) 
And you don't have to fight it (You don't) 
Cause baby you're invited (Baby) 
I know you're gonna like it (I know) 
So tell me how you want it (Tell me) 
And you don't have to fight it (Baby you're invited) 
Cause baby you're invited (Baby) 

[Bridge: Christina Aguilera] 
I got a selection of the positions of affection 
With no pressure 
So tell me 
Tell me how you want it, tell me how you want it babe 
I got a selection of the positions of affection 
With no pressure 
So tell me 
Tell me how you want it 
Tell me how you want it babe 

Do that shit do that shit do it 
Do that shit do that shit do it 
Do that shit do that shit do it 
Do that shit do that shit do it
