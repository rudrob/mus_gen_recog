                    What goes around, comes back around, hey, my baby
What goes around, comes back around, hey, my baby, I say
What goes around, comes back around, hey, my baby
What goes around, comes back around

There was a time I thought, that you did everything right
No lies, no wrong, boy I, must have been outta my mind
So when I think of the time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and I, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it, thank god I dodged a bullet
I'm so over you, so baby good lookin' out. 

I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that
Cause honestly you turned out to be the best thing I never had
You turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'm gon' always be the best thing you never had
Oh yeah, I bet it sucks to be you right now

So sad, you're hurt, boo hoo, oh did you expect me to care
You don't deserve my tears, I guess that's why they ain't there
When I think that there was a time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and baby yes I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it, thank god I dodged a bullet
I'm so over you, baby good lookin' out.

I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that
Cause honestly you turned out to be the best thing I never had
I said you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'll never be the best thing you never had
Oh baby I bet it sucks to be you right now

I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts that I'm the one that's got away
Lord knows that it will take another place, another time, another world, another life
Thank god I found the good in goodbye

I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that
Cause honestly you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I will always be the best thing you never had
Oooh best thing you never had

I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that
Cause honestly you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oooh I will never be the best thing you never had
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now

What goes around, comes back around
What goes around, comes back around
Bet it sucks to be you right now
What goes around, comes back around
I bet it sucks to be you right now
What goes around, comes back around
I bet it sucks to be you right now
