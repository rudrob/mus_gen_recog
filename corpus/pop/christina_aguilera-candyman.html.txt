                    Tarzan and Jane were swinging on a vine
Candyman, candyman
Sipping from a bottle of vodka double wine
Sweet sugar candyman

Hey, yeah
I met him out for dinner on a Friday night
He really got me working up an appetite
He had tattoos up and down his arm
There's nothing more dangerous than a boy with charm

He's a one stop shop, makes my panties drop
He's a sweet talking sugar coated candyman
A sweet talking sugar coated candyman, ooh, yeah, yeah

He took me to the Spider Club on Hollywood and Vine
We drank champagne and we danced all night
We shook the paparazzi for a big surprise (a big surprise)
The gossip tonight will be tomorrow's headline, oh
He's a one stop shop, makes my cherry pop
He's a sweet talking sugar coated candyman (ooh yeah)
A sweet talking sugar coated candyman

He's a one stop shop, makes my cherry pop
He's a sweet talking sugar coated candyman
A sweet talking sugar coated candyman, oh yeah, yeah

Well, by now I'm getting all bothered and hot
When he kissed my mouth it really hit the spot
He had lips like sugarcane, oh
Good things come for boys who wait

Tarzan and Jane were swinging on a vine
Candyman, candyman
Sipping from a bottle of vodka double wine
Candyman, candyman

Sweet sugar candyman
He's a one stop, gotcha hot, making all the panties drop
Sweet sugar candyman
He's a one stop, got me hot, making my ugh pop
Sweet sugar candyman
He's a one stop, get it while it's hot, baby don't stop
Sweet sugar

He's got those lips like sugarcane, yeah
Good things come for boys who wait

He's a one stop shop with a real big ugh
He's a sweet talking sugar coated candyman
(Say what) a sweet talking sugar coated candyman
(Say) a sweet talking sugar coated candyman
(Uh) a sweet talking sugar coated candyman

Candyman, candyman, candyman, candyman
Candyman, candyman, candyman, candyman

Tarzan and Jane were swinging on a vine
Tarzan and Jane were swinging on a vine
Sipping from a bottle of vodka double wine
Sipping from a bottle of vodka double wine
Jane lost her grip and down she fell
Jane lost her grip and down she fell
Squared herself away as she let out a yell
Squared herself away and let out a yell
