                    [Verse 1]
Oh, I need a woman to love me
Don't you understand me, baby?
I need a woman to love
I gotta find her, gotta have her like the air that I breathe
One loving girl that'll understand can't be too much to need

[Chorus]
Can't be now (oh no), can't be now (oh no)
Can't be now (oh no), can't be now (oh no)
Can't be now (oh no)
Can't be this loneliness, baby, surrounding me

[Refrain]
And I know it just can't be (No, it just can't be)
There's got to be some kind of answer (No, it just can't be)
And everywhere I look, there's none around (No, it just can't be)
Whoa, it just can't be (No, it just can't be)

[Verse 2]
Oh, won't you let me hold you?
Honey, just close your eyes
Whoa, won't you let me hold you, dear? Ah, yeah
I wanna just put my arms around you
Like the circles going around the sun
Let me hold you, daddy, at least until the morning comes

[Chorus]
Can't be now (oh no), can't be now (oh no)
Can't be now (oh no), can't be now (oh no)
Can't be now (oh no)
Can't be this loneliness, baby, surrounding me

[Refrain]
And I know it just can't be (No, it just can't be)
There's got to be some kind of answer (No, it just can't be)
And everywhere I look, there's none around (No, it just can't be)
Oh, I realize, oh, I realize (No, it just can't be)
I know it just can't be

[Verse 3]
Oh, I need a woman to love me
Oh, maybe you could help me, please
Oh, I need a woman to love, 'cause I believe that
Someday and somehow, it's bound to come along
'Cause all my dreams and all my plans just cannot turn out wrong

[Chorus]
Can't be now (oh no), can't be now (oh no)
Can't be now (oh no), can't be now (oh no)
Can't be now (oh no)
Can't be this loneliness, baby, surrounding me

[Refrain]
And I know it just can't be (No, it just can't be)
There's got to be some kind of answer (No, it just can't be)
And everywhere I look, there's none around (No, it just can't be)
Whoa, it just can't be (No, it just can't be)
(No, it just can't be, no, it just can't be, no, it just can't be)
