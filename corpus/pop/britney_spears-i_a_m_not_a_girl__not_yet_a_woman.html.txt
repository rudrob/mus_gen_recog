                    I used to think, I had the answers to everything
But now I know that life doesn't always go my way, yeah
Feels like I'm caught in the middle
That's when I realize

I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman
All I need is time, a moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl

There is no need to protect me
It's time that I (I)
Learn to face up to this on my own
I've seen so much more than you know now
So don't tell me to shut my eyes

I'm not a girl (I'm not)
(Not yet a woman)
Not yet a woman
(I'm just trying to find the woman in me)
All I need is time, a moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl

But if you look at me closely
You will see it in my eyes
This girl will always find her way

(I'm not a girl)
I'm not a girl, don't tell me what to believe
(Not yet a woman)
I'm just trying to find the woman in me, yeah
(All I need is time)
Oh, all I need is time
(A moment that is mine)
That's mine
While I'm in between

I'm not a girl (I'm not a girl)
(Not yet a woman)
Not yet a woman
(I'm just trying to find the woman in me)
Not now
All I need is time
(All I need is time)
A moment that is mine
(A moment that is mine)
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl, huhhh
Not yet a woman
