                    She always takes it with a heart of stone
Cause all she does is throws it back to me
I've spent a lifetime looking for someone

Don't try to understand me
Just simply do the things I say

Love is a feeling
Give it when I want it
Cuz I'm on fire
Quench my desire

Give it when I want it
Talk to me woman
Give in to me
Give in to me

You always knew just how to make me cry
And never did I ask you questions why
It seems you get your kicks from hurting me

Don't try to understand me
Because your words just aren't enough

Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Takin' me higher

Love is a woman
I don't want to hear it
Give in to me
Give in to me

You and your friends were laughing at me in town
But it's... Okay
Yes it's... Okay

You won't be laughing girl when I'm not around
I'll be... Okay
And I... I'd never find
Gotta... Some peace of mind
Oh

Don't try to tell me
Because your words just aren't enough

Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Takin' me higher

Talk to me woman
Love is a feeling
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me

Oh

Love is a feeling
I don't wanna hear it
Quench my desire
Takin' me higher
Tell it to the preacher
Satisfy the feeling
Give in to me
Give in to me

I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna hear it
Give in to the fire
Talk to me woman
Quench my desire
Act like a lady
Talk to me baby

Give in to me
Give in to the fire
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me

Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me

Cuz I'm on fire
Talk to me woman
Quench my desire
Give in to the feeling
