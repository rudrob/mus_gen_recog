                    Behind the door of every house
 In every street, in every town
 A story is unfoldin'
 A story is unfoldin' of love and hate
 The morseless wait of hopes and fears
 Of smiles and tears of dreams
 That lie a moldering 

 Behind the door of every house
 In every street, in every town
 The stage is set for playin'
 The stage is set for playin'
 And I call crime a pantomime
 Sweet romance, a ritual dance
 The characters are playin'

 Behind the door of every house
 In every street, in every town
 The people are a waitin'
 The people are a waitin'
 To bare and die, the years go by
 The wedding spree, the funeral teaBR> And still they go on mating

 And to the one the only one
 Remember when the need of man
 Is greater again
 The prayers take off ascending
 Of bountful love to the one above
 Asking for, asking for, asking for, asking for
 A happy ending, a happy ending, a happy ending
 Yeah

                    Â
