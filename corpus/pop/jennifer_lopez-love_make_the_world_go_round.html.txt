                    And love is love, is love, is love is love
Is love, is love, is love, is love

I'm...I'm wide awake
Ready to create
Everything I've imagined
Hearts, without any hate
Crying for change
Causing a chain reaction

Those who hate us and fear us, can not keep us down
Cause we hear in our heartbeat a beautiful sound
If they try to deny us or silence us now
We just say no, oh, yeah, we let 'em know

Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round-ound-ound-ound
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

We...we'll be alright
Living our lives
Finding some satisfaction
No, we're not gonna hide
No fear from our eyes
Love is a call to action

Those who hate us and fear us, can not keep us down
Cause we hear in our heartbeat a beautiful sound
If they try to deny us or silence us now
We just say no, oh, yeah, we let 'em know

Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round-ound-ound-ound
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

Yeah, when the music is playing and the place is jumping
When the bass rattles your ribcage, hey something's changed
I'm dancing face to face with a stranger
A moment of grace, you know that you're safe, and they just
Drop the beat the moment you most needed it
You came in as a question until the music completed it
Me and you in the universe, moving in unison, coming in hot
But in the grand scheme what do we got?
What we got is love even when the sinners hate us
We can not let 'em diminish or intimidate us
We sing out, we got the rhythm and the truth on our side
We cut through the divide and we do it with pride
(Wake up, wake up, wake up)
A generation of innovators unable to patiently wait for change
Cause change is what they've been afraid of
Their malevolence can wait, raise the level of debate
Celebrate, elevate, love, love
(Love make the world go round)

Cannot be killed or swept aside
(Love make the world go round)
And fill the world with music, love and pride
(Love make the world go round
Love make the world go round)
And love is love, is love, is love is love
Is love, is love, is love, is love
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la)

Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round-ound-ound-ound
Love make the world go round
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round

We're not staying inside today
They're not taking our pride away
Le-lo-la-la-lo-le
We're not staying inside today
They're not taking our pride away
Le-lo-la-la-lo-le
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Love make the world go round
