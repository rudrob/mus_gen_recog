                    Does he love me I wanna know
how can I tell if he loves me so?
(Is it in his eyes) oh no you'll be deceived
(is it in his sighs) oh no he'll make believe.
If you wanna know (shoop shoop shoop shoop
shoop shoop shoop) if he loves you so
it's in his kiss (that's where ist is oh yeah).

(Or is it in his face) oh no it's just his charms
(in his warm embrace) oh no that's just his arms.
If you wanna know (shoop shoop shoop shoop
shoop shoop shoop) if he loves you so
it's in his kiss (that's where it is)
woh-oh it's in his kiss (that's where it is).

Chorus: Woh-oh-oh hug him and squeeze him tight
and find out what you want to know.
If it's love if it really is it's there in his kiss.
(How 'bout the way he acts) oh no that's not the way
and you're not listening to all I say.
If you wanna know (shoop shoop shoop shoop
shoop shoop shoop shoop) if he loves you so
it's in his kiss (that's where it is)
woh-oh it's in his kiss (that's where it is).

Chorus

Oh yeah it's in his kiss (that's where it is),
ooh it's in his kiss (that's where it is)
ooh it's in his kiss (that's where it is)
ooh it's in his kiss (that's where it is)
ooh it's in his kiss (that's where it is)
ooh it's in his kiss (that's where it is)
ooh it's in his kiss (that's where it is)
ooh it's in his kiss (that's where it is).
