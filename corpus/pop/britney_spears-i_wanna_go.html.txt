                    Lately I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out
Be a little inappropriate
‘Cause I know that everybody's thinking it 
when the lights out

Shame on me
To need release
Un-uncontrollably

I-I-I wanna go-o-o, all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna show-ow-ow
All the dirt-ir-irt
I got running through my mind whoa 

I-I-I wanna go-o-o, all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna show-ow-ow
All the dirt-ir-irt
I got running through my mind whoa 

Lately people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out
I've been told who I should do it with
To keep both my hands above the bl-an-ket
When the lights out

Shame on me
To need release
Un-uncontrollably

I-I-I wanna go-o-o, all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna show-ow-ow
All the dirt-ir-irt
I got running through my mind whoa 

I-I-I wanna go-o-o, all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna show-ow-ow
All the dirt-ir-irt
I got running through my mind whoa 

Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shame on me
(Shame on me)
To need release (To need release)
Un-uncontrollably
(Uncontrollably-lably-lably-lably-lably-lably)

I-I-I wanna go-o-o, all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna show-ow-ow
All the dirt-ir-irt
I got running through my mind Whoa

I-I-I wanna go-o-o, all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I-I-I wanna show-ow-ow
All the dirt-ir-irt
I got running through my mind whoa
