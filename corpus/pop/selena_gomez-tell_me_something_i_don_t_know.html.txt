                    Everybody tells me that it's so hard to make it,
It's so hard to break it,
There's no way to fake it.
Everybody tells me that it's wrong what I'm feelin',
I shouldn't believe in,
The dreams that I'm dreamin'.

I hear it everyday,
I hear it all the time,
I'm never gonna melt it much,
But they're never gonna change my mind, no.

Tell me, tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know, 
Somethin' I don't know, somethin' I don't know.
Tell me, tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know,
Somethin' I don't know, somethin' I don't know.

How many inches in a mile,
What it takes to make you smile,
Betcha not to trat me like, a child baby.

Tell me, tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know, 
Somethin' I don't know, somethin' I don't know.

Tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know.
Tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know.

Everybody tells me I don't know what I'm doin',
In life I'm presuin',
The odds I'd be losin'.
Everybody tells me that it's one in a milion,
Like one in bilion,
Oh, one in a zillion.

I hear it every day,
I hear it all the time,
I'm never gonna melt it much,
But they're never gonna change my mind, no!

Tell me, tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know, 
Somethin' I don't know, somethin' I don't know.
Tell me, tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know,
Somethin' I don't know, somethin' I don't know.

How many inches in a mile?
What it takes to make you smile?
Betcha not to treat me like, a child baby.

Tell me, tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know, 
Somethin' I don't know, somethin' I don't know.

So here's the track
Like Catrina makes a wish,
Like Medina make 'em say "I'm ready!"
Are you ready for it?
Ya, I'm ready for it!
Really ready for it?
Ya, I'm ready for it.

I'm on my way,
I know I'm gonna get there someday.
It doesn't help when you say
It won't be easy!

Tell me, tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know, 
Somethin' I don't know, somethin' I don't know.
Tell me, tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know,
Somethin' I don't know, somethin' I don't know.

How many inches in a mile?
What it takes to make you smile?
Betcha not to treat me like, a child baby.

Tell me, tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know, 
Somethin' I don't know, somethin' I don't know.
Tell me, tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know,
Somethin' I don't know, somethin' I don't know.

How many inches in a mile?
What it takes to make you smile?
Betcha not to treat me like, a child baby.

Tell me, tell me, tell me somethin' I don't know, 
Somethin' I don't know, somethin' I don't know.
