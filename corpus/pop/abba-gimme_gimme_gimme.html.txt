                    Half past twelve 
And I’m watching the late show 
In my flat all alone 
How I hate to spend 
The evening on my own 
Autumn winds 
Blowing outside the window 
As I look around the room 
And it makes me so 
Depressed to see the gloom 
There’s not a soul out there 
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme 
A man after midnight 
Won’t somebody help me 
Chase the shadows away 
Gimme, gimme, gimme
A man after midnight 
Take me through the darkness 
To the break of the day

Movie stars 
Find the end of the rainbow 
With a fortune to win 
It’s so different from 
The world I’m living in 
Tired of TV 
I open the window 
And I gaze into the night 
But there’s nothing there to see 
No one in sight 
There’s not a soul out there 
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme 
A man after midnight 
Won’t somebody help me 
Chase the shadows away 
Gimme, gimme, gimme
A man after midnight 
Take me through the darkness 
To the break of the day

Gimme, gimme, gimme
A man after midnight... x2

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme 
A man after midnight 
Won’t somebody help me 
Chase the shadows away 
Gimme, gimme, gimme
A man after midnight 
Take me through the darkness 
To the break of the day x2
