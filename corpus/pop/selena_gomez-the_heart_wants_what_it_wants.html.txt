                    When I was on stage and I was thinking of...
I felt like I - I know, I know him though,
I know his heart, and I know what he wouldn’t do to hurt me
But I didn’t realize that feeling so confident, 
feeling so great about myself and then it’d just be completely shattered. 
By one thing. By something so stupid
But then you make me feel crazy, make me feel like it’s my fault
I was in pain

You got me sippin' on something
I can't compare to nothing
I've ever known, I'm hoping
That after this fever, I'll survive

I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm prayin'
That I'm gonna make it out alive

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I bet the odd's against it all

Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you'd disappear and make me wait

And every second's like torture
Hell won't endure no more, so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I bet the odd's against it all

Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
The breathless moments breaking me down
Down, down, down, down

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I bet the odd's against it all

Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
