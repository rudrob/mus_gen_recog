                    It's not so easy loving me
It gets so complicated, all the things you gotta be
Everything's changing but you're the truth
I'm amazed by all your patience, everything I put you through

And when I'm about to fall
Somehow you're always waiting, your open arms to catch me
You're gonna save me from myself, from myself, yes
You're gonna save me from myself, ooo, ohh, yeah

My love is tainted by your touch
Well, some guys have shown me Aces but you've got that Royal Flush
I know it's crazy everyday
Well, tomorrow may be shaky but you never turn away

Don't ask me why I'm crying
'Cause when I start to crumble, you know how to keep me smiling
You always save me from myself, from myself, myself
You're gonna save me from myself

I know it's hard, it's hard
But you've broken all my walls
You've been my strength, so strong

And don't ask me why I love you
It's obvious your tenderness
Is what I need to make me
A better woman to myself, to myself, myself
You're gonna save me from my, myself

                    Â
