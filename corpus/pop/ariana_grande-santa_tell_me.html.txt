                    Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm tryna to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
Let it snow is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's true love
That he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on new year's day I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's true love
That he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy

Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Oh I wanna have him beside me like ohh woo ooo
On the 25th by the fireplace ohh woo ooo
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart ...

If he won't be 
If he won't be 
Santa tell me 
If he won't be here

Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Santa tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa tell me if he really cares
Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year
