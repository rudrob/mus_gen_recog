(Justin Bieber)
You know you love me
I know you care
Just shout whenever, and I'll be there
You want my love
You want my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart

Are we an item?
Girl, quit playing!
We're just friends, 
What are you saying?!
Said there's another,
and look right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time

And I was like
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like
Baby, baby, baby, no
Like
Baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like
Baby, baby, baby, no
Like
Baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

For you , I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool 
But I'm losing you
I'll buy you anything
I'll buy you any ring!
I'm in pieces
Baby, fix me
And you shake me till you wake me from this bad dream
I'm goin' down, down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love wont be around

And I'm like
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like
Baby, baby, baby, no
Like
Baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like
Baby, baby, baby, no
Like
Baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

(Ludacris)
Luda!
When I was thirteen, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us
Or could ever come above
She had me going crazy
Oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily
Don't need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound
And skip a beat when I see her in the street
And at school on the playground
But I really wanna see her on a weekend
She knows she got me dazing
'Cause she was so amazing
And now, my heart is breakin'
But I just keep on saying...

(Justin Bieber)
Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like
Baby, baby, baby, no
Like
Baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby, oh
Like
Baby, baby, baby, no
Like
Baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

(Now I'm all gone)
Yeahh, yeah, yeah
Yeahh, yeah, yeah
(Now I'm all gone)
Yeahh, yeah, yeah
Yeahh, yeah, yeah
Yeahh, yeah, yeah
Now I'm all gone (gone, gone, gone)
I'm gone
