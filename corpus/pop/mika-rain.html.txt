                    Is it really necessary
Every single day
You're making me more ordinary
In every possible way

This ordinary mind is broken
You did it and you don't even know
You're leaving me with words unspoken
You better get back 'cause I'm ready for

More than this, whatever it is
Baby, I hate days like this
Caught in a trap, I can't look back
Baby, I hate days like this

When it rain and rain and rain and rains
When it rain and rain and rain and rains
When it rain and rain and rain and rains
When it rain and rain and rain and rains

More than this, baby
I hate days like

Trying to be ordinary
Was it me who was the fool
Thought you found the man you wanted
'til you turned him into something new

Well even if our minds are broken
There's something that I need you to know
It's nothing like the life we wanted
You better move on cause I'm ready for

More than this, whatever it is
Baby, I hate days like this
Caught in a trap, I can't look back
Baby, I hate days like this

When it rain and rain and rain and rains
When it rain and rain and rain and rains
When it rain and rain and rain and rains
When it rain and rain and rain and rains

When it rain and rain and rain and rains
When it rain and rain and rain and rains
When it rain and rain and rain and rains
When it rain and rain and rain and rains

More than this, baby
I hate days like

I'm not angry
Don't know what to do
After all the years that I spent with you
I can't blame you for the things you say
You were used to hide away

More than this, whatever it is
Baby, I hate days like this
Caught in a trap, I can't look back
Baby, I hate days like this

When it rain and rain and rain and rains
When it rain and rain and rain and rains
When it rain and rain and rain and rains
When it rain and rain and rain and rains

When it rain and rain and rain and rains
When it rain and rain and rain and rains
When it rain and rain and rain and rains
When it rain and rain and rain and rains

You're leaving me with words unspoken
You better get back, 'cause I'm ready for
More than this, baby 
I hate days like
