                    This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love
Like it's forever
Then live the rest of our life
But not together

Wake up in the morning
Stumble on my life
Can't get no love
Without sacrifice
If anything should happen
I guess I wish you well
Mmm a little bit of heaven
but a little bit of hell

This is the hardest story
That I've ever told
No hope or love or glory
Happy ending's gone forevermore
I feel as if I'm wasting
And I wasting every day

This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love
Like it's forever
Then live the rest of our life
But not together

Two o'clock in the morning
Something's on my mind
Can't get no rest
Keep walking around
If I pretend that nothing
Ever went wrong
I can get to my sleep
I can think that we just carried on

This is the hardest story
That I've ever told
No hope or love or glory
Happy ending's gone forevermore
I feel as if I'm wasting
And I wasted every day

This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we love
Like it's forever
And live the rest of our life
But not together

Little bit of love, little bit of love
Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love
Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, love

I feel as if I'm wasting
And I wasted every day
Hey, hey, hey, hey

This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we loved
Like it's forever
Then live the rest of our lives
But not together

This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
This is the way that we loved
Like it's for ever
Then live the rest of our lives
But not together

This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No happy ending
