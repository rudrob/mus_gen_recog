If I could escape I would, but first of all, let me say 
I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way 
‘Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor 
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator 
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold? 

If I could escape (escape) and recreate a place that’s my own world (own world) 
And I could be your favorite girl forever, perfectly together 
And tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape) 
If I could be sweet (be sweet)
(Sorry boy)
I know I've been a real bad girl (bad girl) 
(I'll try to change) 
I didn't mean for you to get hurt, whatsoever
We can make it better 
And tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)

Woowhoo, yeewhoo (I wanna get away, get away) 
Woowhoo, yeewhoo (to our sweet escape, sweet escape) 
Woowhoo, yeewhoo (I wanna get away, get away) 
Woowhoo, yeewhoo (yeah) 

You held me down, I'm at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out, I need to get me out of this joint
Come on let's bounce, counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around, let's look for some common ground 
So baby, times get a little crazy 
I've been getting a little lazy, waiting on you to come and save me 
I can see that your angry by the way that you treat me 
Hopefully you don't leave me, wanna take you with me
