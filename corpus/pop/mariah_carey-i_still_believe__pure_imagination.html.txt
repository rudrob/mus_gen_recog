                    No matter what baby
No matter what people say (no matter what they say)
We're gonna believe
We can still be together
No matter what baby
No matter what people say (no matter what they say)
We're gonna believe
We can still be together

Baby I still believe (still believe)
And it's more than my imagination
It's so real
I know we're gonna be together
(And I believe we can still be together)

If you still believe (I do believe)
You will find
Everything you're searching for, maybe more

But boy you seem to be
Lost in uncertainty
But when you wake up
You will know you never should've let it go

Believe in your feelin', that's always been sure
I just weren't too certain yours were
Legitimate, genuine, really the real McCoy

And after all this time
You look into my eyes
And everything is still the same
My love for you won't fade away

Baby I still believe
And it's more than my imagination
It's so real
I know we're gonna be together
Baby I had a dream
And it's more than my imagination
Because I still believe we belong together

I'm still a believer of this, so stop
Just listen and look into my eyes
I want you to visualize
And realize
They say that it never been to easy
Being Krayzie Bone
To be's even better than we're to persuade you
Rather than in my brain, crunk who we say
I figure that's why they be calling me Krayzie
'Cause I still maintain
But we gotta struggle through all them hard times
And I gotta tell you peace and happiness is hard to find
(Come on)
We can get there
I'm not tryin' to make excuses or reasons
But these demons got me seeing things
That's really been misleadin' me
But baby, that's just my life
Maybe I'm just a thug, cold hearted
But I can feel the love
Just keep the faith and don't break it
Shake all them fakers and haters
That makes me feel we will make it
I say yeah, uh huh
You got to believe it
You got to believe it

Baby I still believe (no matter, no matter what they say)
And it's more than my imagination (I still)
It's so real (so real)
I know we're gonna be together (you know, you know)
Baby I had a dream (no matter, no matter what they say)
And it's more than my imagination (baby I have a dream)
Because I still believe we belong together (I still believe we can still be together)

If you wanna view paradise (if you want)
Think about our love and view it (should view it)
Nothing could be closer to it (because)
If we don't believe, we'll lose it (it's too late)

[Da Brat]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
I know you be missin' every bit of the feelin'
You get when you use to hit this shit
'Cause can't nobody fuck like me (heh heh)
They ownin' my business
And vicious lies can lead
To innocent victims losing their lives for greed
Paparazzi invading my privacy
Obviously, it's prophecy
Ain't no Article that can stoppin' me (you can't stop)
And even if my label drop me
I'ma still sell copies
I'm So So phenomenonal Def
Most know me for leaving bullet holes
In the abdominal area, throat and chest
One of the baddest motherfuckers left (you know?)
Still puffin' and lovin' nothin' until my last breath
I only believe it was possible
You ain't none my amigo, my friend
They lay in the dugout, pretendin' to be unstoppable
Lose the ego!
Get in the way of my guns
And they ain't got no problem droppin' you (uh huh)
The best thing for you to do is run
Cuz I'm plannin' on poppin' you
I gotta live my life, my life (damizza)
For Da Brat don't get no sunshine

Baby I still believe (I still)
And it's more than my imagination
It's so real (I know we will)
I know we're gonna be together (I know we will)
Baby I had a dream
And it's more than my imagination
Because I still believe we belong together (hey love, forgive my love)

Baby I still believe (and I still believe)
And it's more than my imagination (see it's more than my imagination)
It's so real
I know we're gonna be together
Baby I had a dream
And it's more than my imagination
Because I still believe we belong together

Baby I still believe
And it's more than my imagination
It's so real
I know we're gonna be together (we're gonna believe we can still be together)
