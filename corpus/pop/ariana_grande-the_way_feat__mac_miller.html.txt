What we gotta do right here is go back, back to the top

[Intro]
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it

[Mac Miller]
Say, I’m thinking ’bout her every second, every hour
Do my singing in the shower
Picking petals off of flowers like
Do she love me, do she love me not? (love me not)
I ain’t a player, I just crush a lot (crush a lot)

[Ariana Grande]
You give me that kind of something
Want it all the time, need it everyday
On a scale of 1 to 10 I’m at 100
Never get enough, I can’t stay away
If you want it, I got it, I got it everyday
You can get whatever you need, from me
Stay by your side, I’ll never leave you
I ain’t going nowhere cause you’re a keeper

[Chorus]
So don’t you worry, baby you got me
I got a bad boy, I must admit it
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it
And I don’t care who sees it babe
I don’t wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me
I love the way you make me feel
I love the way (I love it, I love it)
Baby I love the way you make me feel
Oh, I love the way, the way I love you

[Ariana Grande]
Oh, so crazy you get my heart jumping
When you put your lips on mine
And honey, it ain’t a question (quick question)
Cause boy I know just what you like
So if you need it, I got it, I got it everyday
Be your lover, and friend, you’ll find it all in me
Stay by your side, I’ll never leave you
And I ain’t going nowhere cause you’re a keeper

[Chorus]
So don’t you worry, baby you got me
I got a bad boy, I must admit it
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it
And I don’t care who sees it babe
I don’t wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me
I love the way you make me feel
I love the way (I love it, I love it)
Baby I love the way you make me feel
Oh, I love the way, the way I love you

[Mac Miller]
Uh, I make you feel so fine, make you feel so fine
I hope you hit me on my celly when I sneak in your mind
You a princess to the public, but a freak when it’s time
Said your bed be feeling lonely,
So you’re sleeping in mine
Come and watch a movie with me,
American Beauty or Bruce Almighty, that's groovy,
Just come and move closer to me
I got some feelings for you,
I’m not gonna get bored of
But baby you an adventure so let me come and explore you

[Chorus]
So don’t you worry, baby you got me
I got a bad boy, I must admit it
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it
And I don’t care who sees it babe
I don’t wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me
I love the way (you make me feel) (I love the way)

I love the way (I love the way)
Baby I love the way (I love the way)
Oh, I love the way (I love it)
I love the way (you make me feel)
I love the way (I love it)
Baby I love the way (you make me feel)
Oh, I love the way, the way I love you

The way I love you, you, you, yeah, the way
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, the way I love you
