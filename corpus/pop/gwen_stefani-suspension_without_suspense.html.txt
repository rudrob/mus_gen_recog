                    My divorce from dependence
Thats when you found me
I was too soft
And we always were in trouble
Odds stacked against us
And troubles what we are

We get so far
And then it just start rewinding
And the same old song
Were playing it again
Suspension without suspense

Now that Ive murdered your inspiration
And I forced you off
Do you hate me?
Do you want revenge
I want to call you but I wont

We get so far
And then it just starts rewinding
And the same old song
Were playing it again
Suspension without suspense

Oh the pessimistic protection plan
Moderation loving
Ive been hardened by the circumstance
We knew this was coming

We get so far
And then it just starts rewinding
And the same old song
Were playing it again
Suspension without suspense

We get so far
And then it just starts rewinding
And the same old song
Were playing it again
Suspension without suspense
Intentions without intent
But I dont want the love we have to end

                    Â
