Gaga (oh-oh, eh)

I've had a little bit too much (much) (oh-oh ooh)
All of the people start to rush (start to rush by)
A dizzy twister dance
Can't find a drink or man
Where are my keys?
I lost my phone (phone) (oh-oh ooh)

What's going on, on the floor?
I love this record baby but I can't see straight anymore keep it cool
What's the name of this club?
I can't remember but it's alright, a-alright

Just dance!
Gonna be okay
Da da doo doot-n

Da da doo doot-n
Just dance!
Gonna be okay
D-d-d dance, dance, dance, just j-j-just dance!

Wish I could shut my playboy mouth (oh-oh ooh)
How'd I turn my shirt inside out (inside out right)
Control your poison babe
Roses have thorns they say
And we’re all getting hosed tonight! (Oh-oh ooh)

What's going on, on the floor?

Colby O'Donis:
When I come through on the dance floor checking out that catalog
Can't believe my eyes so many women without a flaw
And I ain't gonna give it up, steady trying to pick it up like a call
I'm a hit it up beat it up latch on to it until tomorrow yeah
Shorty I can see that you got so much energy
The way you twirling up them hips round and round
And there's no reason at all why you can't leave here with me
In the meantime stay and let me watch you break it down and 

Dance gonna be okay
Da da doo doot-n
Just dance!
Spin that record babe
Da da doo doot-n

Gonna be okay
Da da doo doot-n

Woo! Let's go!

Half psychotic sick hypnotic got my blueprint it's symphonic
Half psychotic sick hypnotic got my blueprint electronic x2

Go use your muscle car-ve it out work it, hustle!
(I got it, just stay close enough to get it on)
Don't slow! Drive it, clean it lysol, bleed it
Spend the last dough (I got it) in your pocko! (I got it)

Just dance!
Gonna be okay
