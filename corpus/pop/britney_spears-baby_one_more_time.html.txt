Oh baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're outta sight, yeah
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now
Oh because

My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign, hit me baby one more time

Oh baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Boy you got me blinded
Oh pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
That's not the way I planned it
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now
Oh because

My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign, hit me baby one more time

Oh baby, baby, oh baby, baby

Oh baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
Oh pretty baby
I shouldn't have let you go

I must confess that my loneliness is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe?
That you will be here and give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign, hit me baby one more time

I must confess that my loneliness is killing me now
(My loneliness is killing me)
(I must confess I still believe)
Don't you know I still believe?
 (When I'm not with you I lose my mind)
That you will be here and give me a sign (give me a sign)
Hit me baby one more time
