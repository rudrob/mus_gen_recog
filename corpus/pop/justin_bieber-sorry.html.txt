                    You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time could someone call the referee
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness 

I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice 
And by once to twice I Mean maybe a couple of hundred times 
So let me oh let me redeem oh redeem oh myself tonight 
Cause I just need one more shot second chances 

Yeah,

Is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm missing more than just your body 
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I kno-o-ow that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry
Yeah
Sorry
Yeah
Sorry
Yeah I kno-o-ow that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'll take every single piece of the blame 
If you want me to 
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go I'll go and then 
You go you go out and spill the truth 
Can we both say the words and forget this?

Yeah,

Is it too late now to say sorry?
Cause I'm missing more than just your body 
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I kno-o-ow that let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm not just trying to get you back on me
Cause I'm missing more than just your body 
Is it too late now to say sorry? 
Yeah I kno-o-w that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry
Yeah
Sorry
Ooh
Sorry
Yeah I kno-o-ow that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'm sorry
Yeah

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
