                    Where would I be boy, if you didn't love me boy
If you didn't love me boy?

I was drifting up then you pulled me in
Lightning on my skin, oh
Turn me on just like a switch, now you got me lit
Oh, no, you didn't

Just so you know though
I want a shot of your vitamin
Fill up my Solo
Cup when I'm feeling so lonely
I'm losing my control
I need some water so water me
I need some water so water me

Where would I be boy, if you didn't love me boy?
If you didn't love me boy?
Where would I be boy, if you didn't love me boy?
If you didn't love me boy?

There's nothing I can do
I just can't resist
You've got the perfect kiss
Turn me on just like a switch
Now you got me lit
Oh no you didn't

Just so you know though
I want a shot of your vitamin
Fill up my Solo
Cup when I'm feeling so lonely
I'm losing my control
I need some water so water me
I need some water so water me

Where would I be boy, if you didn't love me boy?
If you didn't love me boy?
Where would I be boy, if you didn't love me boy?
If you didn't love me boy?

Yeah you're putting in overtime
I scored, you are the prize
What? Uh uh
What what? Uh uh
Yeah you're putting in overtime
I scored, you are the prize
What? Uh uh
What what? Uh uh
I just hang with you now
I guess that's just what I'm gon' do now
I just lean on you now
I guess that's just what I'm gon' do now

Where would I be boy, if you didn't love me boy?
If you didn't love me boy?
Where would I be boy, if you didn't love me boy?
If you didn't love me boy?

If you didn't love me boy
Where would I be, boy
If you didn't love me boy
Where would I be boy, if you didn't love me boy?
If you didn't love me boy?
