                    You're standing at the door 
I'm falling to the floor 
You look even better than you did before 
I'm staring at my feet 
Wondering if I can do this 
It's been a while but I couldn't forget you 

Just a little look has got me feeling things 
Just a little taste has got me seeing things 
Just a little touch has got me off the chains 
Doing things that I don't want to 

Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up) 
Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough) 
Do it like you do it to me just open up 
Don't you know how much I want you?

We're sitting real close and I can feel your breath 
I wanna touch your hand but I lay back 
Cuz you know this thing could sprial in the night 
I've changed my mind I'm ready for you this time

Just a little look has got me feeling things 
Just a little taste has got me seeing things 
Just a little touch has got me off the chains 
Doing things that I don't want to

Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up) 
Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough) 
Do it like you do it to me just open up 
Don't you know how much I want you?

Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up) 
Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough) 
Do it like you do it to me just open up 
Don't you know how much I want you?

We're sitting real close I can feel your breath 
I wanna touch your hand but I lay back 
We're sitting real close I can feel your breath
I wanna touch your hand I can't find it all

Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up) 
Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough) 
Do it like you do it to me just open up 
Don't you know how much I want you?

Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up) 
Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough) 
Do it like you do it to me just open up 
Don't you know how much I want you?
