                    I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it" I've had enough 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space, what?

Then you come around again and say
Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day
I say, I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you

We called it off again last night
But this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends 
Walk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
Like... ever
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me, falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you, would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

You called me up again tonight
But this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends 
Talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

I used to think that we were forever ever
And I used to say, never say never

(Uh, so he calls me up and he's like, I still love you
And I'm like, I just,  I mean this is exhausting, you know, like
We are never getting back together, like ever)

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends 
Talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

We, getting back together
We, getting back together

You go talk to your friends 
Talk to my friends, talk to me 
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

                    Â
