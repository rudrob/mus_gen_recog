                    Maybe I need some rehab
Or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession
I'm seeing it in my dreams
I'm looking down every alley
I'm making these desperate calls
I'm staying up all night hoping
Hitting my head against the wall

What you got boy is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

Because your love your love your love is my drug
Your love your love your love
I said your love your love your love is my drug
Your love your love your love

Won't listen to any advice
Mama's telling me I should think twice
I'm left to my own devices
I'm addicted, it's a crisis

My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgements getting kinda hazy
My steeze is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a lovesick crack-head

What you got boy is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

Because your love your love your love is my drug
Your love your love your love
I said your love your love your love is my drug
Your love your love your love

I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave

Hey, so I got a question
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love, uh your drug?
Your drug, uh your drug
Uh your drug, is my love your drug

Because your love your love your love is my drug
Your love your love your love
I said your love your love your love is my drug
Your love your love your love

Hey...Hey...
So?
Your love  your love  your love your love.., is my drug
I like your beard
