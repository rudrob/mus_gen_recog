                    Teenage dreams in a teenage circus
Running around like a clown on purpose
Who gives a damn about the family you come from
No giving up when you’re young and you want some

Running around again
Running from running

Waking up in the midday sun
What’s to live for
You could see what I’ve done
I stay out of motion in the light of day
I was hiding from the things that you’d say

We are not what you think we are
We are golden, we are golden
We are not what you think we are
We are golden, we are golden

Teenage dreams in a teenage circus
Running around like a clown on purpose
Who gives a damn about the family you come from
No giving up when you’re young and you want some

Running around again
Running from running
Running around again
Running from running

I was a boy at an open door
Why you staring
Do you still think that you know
Looking for treasure
In the things that you threw
Like a magpie
I live for glitter, not you

We are not what you think we are
We are golden, we are golden
We are not what you think we are
We are golden, we are golden

Teenage dreams in a teenage circus
Running around like a clown on purpose
Who gives a damn about the family you come from
No giving up when you’re young and you want some

Now I’m sitting alone
And I'm looking for help
Left here on my own
I’m gonna hurt myself
Many years have gone by
I’m still wondering why
Had to let the world
Let it bleed me dry

We are not what you think we are
We are not what you think we are
We are not what you think we are
We are golden, we are golden

Teenage dreams in a teenage circus
Running around like a clown on purpose
Who gives a damn about the family you come from
No giving up when you’re young and you want some

Running around again
Running from running
Running around again
Running from running

We are not what you think we are
We are golden, we are golden
