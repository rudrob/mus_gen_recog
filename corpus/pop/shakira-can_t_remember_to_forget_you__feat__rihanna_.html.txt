I left a note on my bed­post
Said not to repeat yesterday’s mista­kes
What I tend to do when it comes to you
I see only the good, selec­tive memory
The way you make me feel yeah
You got a hold on me
I’ve never met some­one so dif­fe­rent
Oh here we go
You part of me now, you part of me
So where you go I fol­low, fol­low, fol­low

[Shakira]:
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
I can’t remem­ber to for­get you
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
I keep for­get­ting I sho­uld let you go
But when you look at me, the only memory,
Is us kis­sing in the moon­li­ght
Oh, oh, oooh, oh, Och, oh, oooh, oh
I can’t remem­ber to for­get you!

I can’t remem­ber to for­get you!

[Rihanna]:
I go back again, fall off the train
Land in his bed
Repeat yesterday’s mista­kes
What I’m try­ing to say is not to for­get
You see only the good, selec­tive memory
The way he makes me feel like
The way he makes me feel
I never see to act so stu­pid
Oh here we go
He a part of me now, he a part of me
[Shakira]:
So where he goes I fol­low, fol­low, fol­low, oh

[Shakira]:
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
[Rihanna]:
I can’t remem­ber to for­get you!
[Shakira]:

Oh, oh, oooh, oh
Oh, oh, oooh, oh

[Rihanna]:
But when you look at me, the only memory,
Is us kis­sing in the moon­li­ght
[Shakira]:
Oh, oh, oooh, oh
Oh, oh, oooh, oh

[Shakira]:
I’d rob and I’d kill to keep him with me
I’d do any­thing for that boy
I’d give my last dime to hold him toni­ght
I’d do any­thing for that boy

[Rihanna]:
I’d rob and I’d kill to keep him with me
