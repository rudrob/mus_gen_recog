                    This kitten got your tongue tied in knots, I see
Spit it out ‘cause I'm dying for company

I notice that you got it
You notice that I want it
You know that I can take it
To the next level, baby
If you want this goodish
Sicker than the remix
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight

I can't take it, take it, take no more
Never felt like, felt like this before
Come on get me, get me on the floor
DJ what you, what you waiting for?

Woah oh oh oh oh oh ohhh x8

Watch me move, when I lose, when I lose it hard
Get you off with the touch dancing in the dark

You notice what I'm wearing
I notice that you're staring
You know that I can take it
To the next level, baby
Harder than the A-list
Next one on my hit list
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight

I can't take it, take it, take no more
Never felt like, felt like this before
Come on get me, get me on the floor
DJ what you, what you waiting for?

Woah oh oh oh oh oh ohhh x8

See the sunlight, we ain't stopping
Keep on dancing till the world ends
If you feel it let it happen
Keep on dancing till the world ends
Keep on dancing till the world ends
Keep on dancing till the world ends

Woah oh oh oh oh oh ohhh x8

See the sunlight, we ain't stopping
Keep on dancing till the world ends
If you feel it let it happen
Keep on dancing till the world ends
