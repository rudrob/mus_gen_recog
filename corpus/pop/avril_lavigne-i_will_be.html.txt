                    There’s nothing I could say to you
Nothing I could ever do to make you see
What you mean to me
All the pain, the tears i cried
Still you never said 'goodbye'
And now I know
How far you’d go
I know I let you down
But it’s not like that now
This time I never let you go

I will be all that you want
And get myself together
'Cause you keep me from falling apart
All my life I’ll be with you forever
To get you through the day
And make everything okay

I thought that I had everything
I didn’t know what life could bring
But now I see, honestly
You're the one thing I got right
The only one I let inside
Now I can breathe, 'cause you're here with me
And if I let you down
I'll turn all around
'Cause I will never let you go

I will be all that you want
And get myself together
'Cause you keep me from falling apart
All my life I’ll be with you forever
To get you through the day
And make everything okay

'Cause without you I can’t sleep
I'm not gonna ever, ever let you leave
You're all I’ve got, you’re all I want, yeah
And without you I don’t know what I’d do
I can’t never, ever live a day without you
Here with me, do you see,
You're all I need

I will be all that you want
And get myself together
'Cause you keep me from falling apart
All my life I’ll be with you forever
To get you through the day
And make everything okay

I will be all that you want
And get myself together
'Cause you keep me from falling apart
All my life I’ll be with you forever
To get you through the day
And make everything okay
