                    You know that I'm a crazy bitch
 I do what I want when I feel like it 
 All I wanna do is lose control 
 Oh oh
 But you don't really give a shit 
 You go with it, go with it, go with it 
 'Cause you're fucking crazy rock 'n roll

 You said "Hey, what's your name" 
 It took one look and now I'm not the same 
 Yeah, you said "Hey", and since that day
 You stole my heart and you're the one to blame

 And that's why I smile 
 It's been a while, since every day and everything has felt this right 
 And now, you turn it all around, and suddenly you're all I need, the reason why 
 I smile

 Last night I blacked out I think 
 What did you, what did you put in my drink 
 I remember making out and then oh oh 
 I woke up with a new tattoo 
 Your name was on me and my name was on you 
 I would do it all over again 

 You said "Hey, what's your name"
 It took one look and now I'm not the same 
 Yeah, you said "Hey", and since that day 
 You stole my heart and you're the one to blame

 And that's why I smile 
 It's been a while, since every day and everything has felt this right
 And now, you turn it all around, and suddenly, you're all I need, the reason why 
 I smile 

 You know that I'm a crazy bitch
 I do what I f want when I feel like it 
 All I wanna do is lose control 
 You know that I'm a crazy bitch
 I do what I f want when I feel like it 
 All I wanna do is lose control 

 And that's why I smile 
 It's been a while, since every day and everything has felt this right 
 And now, you turn it all around, and suddenly, you're all I need, the reason why 
 I smile

 It's been a while, since every day and everything has felt this right 
 And now, you turn it all around, and suddenly, you're all I need, the I reason why 
 I smile 

 The reason why, I smile
