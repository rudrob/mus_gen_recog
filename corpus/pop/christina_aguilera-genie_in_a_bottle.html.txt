                    Come on, come on
Ohh, whow x2

I feel like I've been locked up tight 
For a century of lonely nights 
Waiting for someone to release me 
You're licking your lips and blowing kisses my way 
But that don’t mean I'm gonna give it away 
Baby, baby, baby (baby, baby, baby) 

Ooohhh, my body's saying let's go 
Ooohhh, but my heart is saying no, no

If you wanna be with me
Baby there's a price you pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta rub me the right way 
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true 
You gotta make a big impression (oh yeah)
Gotta like what you do 

I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Gotta rub me the right way, honey 
I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Come, come, come on and let me out

The music's fading and the lights down low 
Just one more dance and then we’re good to go 
Waiting for someone who needs me
Hormones racing at the speed of light 
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight 
Baby, baby, baby (baby, baby, baby) 

Ooohhh, my body's saying let's go 
Ooohhh, but my heart is saying no
(But my heart is saying no)

If you wanna be with me
Baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle (I'm a genie in a bottle)
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me (ohh)
I can make your wish come true (your wish come true ohh)
Just come and set me free baby
And I'll be with you

I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Gotta rub me the right way, honey 
I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Come, come, come on and let me out

I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Gotta rub me the right way, honey
(If you wanna be with me)
I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Come, come, come on and let me out

Ooohhh, my body's saying let's go 
Ooohhh, but my heart is saying no, no

If you wanna be with me
Baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle (I'm a genie in a bottle)
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression
Gotta like what you do

If you wanna be with me
Baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle (In a bottle baby)
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me (If you wanna be with me)
I can make your wish come true
Just come and set me free baby
And I'll be with you

I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Come, come, come on and let me out
