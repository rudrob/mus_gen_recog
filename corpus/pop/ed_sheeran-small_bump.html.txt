                    You’re just a small bump unborn in four months you’re brought to life
 You might be left with my hair but you’ll have your mother’s eyes
I’ll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can
 But for now you’re a scan of my unmade plans
 A small bump in four months you brought to life

And I’ll whisper quietly and give you nothing but truth
 If you’re not inside me, I’ll put my future in you

You are my one and only
 And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb
 And hold me tight
 You are my one and only
 You can wrap your fingers round my thumb
 And hold me tight
 And you’ll be alright

You’re just a small bump, I know you’ll grow into your skin
 With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
 Fingernails the size of a half grain of rice
 And eyelids closed to be soon open wide
 A small bump, in four months you’ll open your eyes

And I’ll hold you tightly and tell you nothing but truth
 If you’re not inside me, I’ll put my future in you

You are my one and only
 And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb
 And hold me tight
 You are my one and only
 And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb
 And hold me tight
 And you’ll be alright

Then you can lie with me, with your tiny feet
 When you’re half asleep I’ll leave you be
 Right in front of me, for a couple weeks
 So I can keep you safe

‘Cos you are my one and only
 You can wrap your fingers round my thumb
 And hold me tight
 You are my one and only
 You can wrap your fingers round my thumb
 And hold me tight
 And you’ll be alright

‘Cos you were just a small bump unborn for four months, then torn from life
 Maybe you were needed up there but we’re still unaware as why.
