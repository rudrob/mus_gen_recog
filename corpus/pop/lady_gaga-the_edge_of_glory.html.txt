                    There are no reason you and me should be alone tonight
Yeah baby, tonight yeah baby
But I got a reason that you-hoo should take me home tonight
I need a man that thinks it right when it's so wrong
Tonight yeah baby
Tonight yeah baby
Right on the limit’s where we know we both belong tonight

It's hot to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to
To the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love

I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment of truth
I’m on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you

Another shot before we kiss the other side alone tonight
Yeah baby, tonight yeah baby
I'm on the edge of something final we call life tonight
All right!
All right!
Put on your shades 'cause I'll be dancing in the flames tonight
Yeah baby, tonight yeah baby
It isn't hell if everybody knows my name tonight
All right! 
All right!

It's hot to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to
To the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love

I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment of truth
I’m on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you

I'm on the edge with you x2

I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment of truth
I’m on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you
I'm on the edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
The edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hanging on a moment with you

I'm on the edge with you
With you
With you
With you
With you
With you x4
