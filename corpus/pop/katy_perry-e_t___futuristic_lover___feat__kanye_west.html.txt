                    Kanye West:
I got a dirty mind
I got filthy ways
I'm trying to bathe my ape (ape)
In your milky way (way)
I'm a legend
I'm irreverent
I be reverend
I'll be so far up
We don't give a fuck
Welcome to the danger zone
Step into the fantasy
You are not invited to the other side of sanity
They're calling me an alien a big headed astronaut
Maybe it's because your boy Yeezy get ass a lot

Katy Perry:
You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing

They say, be afraid
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

You're from a whole ‘nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your loving
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your power
Stun me with your laser
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

You're from a whole ‘nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your loving
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

There is this transcendental on another level
Boy, you're my lucky star
I wanna walk on your wave length
And be there when you vibrate
For you I risk it all, all

Kanye West:
I know a bar out in Mars
Where they driving spaceships instead of cars
Cop a Prada space suit about the stars
Getting stupid high, straight up out the jars
Pockets on Shrek, rockets on deck
Tell me what's next? Alien sex?
I’ma disrobe you
Then I’ma probe you
See I abducted you
So I tell you what to do
I tell you what to do, what to do, what to do

Katy Perry:
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your loving
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial

Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
