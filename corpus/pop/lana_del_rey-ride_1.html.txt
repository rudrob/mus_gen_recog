                    I was in the winter of my life. And the men I met along the road were my only summer. At night I fell sleep with visions of myself dancing and laughing and crying with them. Three years down the line of being on an endless world tour and my memories of them were the only things that sustained me and my only real happy times.

I was a singer, not a very popular one. I once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet. But upon an unfortunate series of events saw those dreams dashed and divided like million stars in the night sky. That I wished on over and over again sparkling and broken. But I really didn’t mind because I knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted and then losing it to know what true freedom is.

When the people I used to know found out what I had been doing, how I had been living, they asked me why but there’s no use in talking to people who have a home. They have no idea what it’s like to seek safety in other people for home to be wherever you lie you head.

I was always an unusual girl. My mother told me that I had a chameleon soul, no moral compass pointing me due north, no fixed personality, just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and wavering as the ocean. And if I said I didn’t plan for it to turn out this way, I’d be lying.

Because I was born to be the other woman who belonged to no one, who belonged to everyone, who had nothing, who wanted everything, with a fire for every experience and an obsession for freedom that terrified me to the point that I couldn’t even talk about it and pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me.

I've been out on that open road
You can be my full time daddy, white and gold
Singing blues has been getting old
You can be my full time baby, hot or cold

Don't break me down
I've been traveling too long
I've been trying too hard
With one pretty song

I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
So I just ride, just ride, I just ride, I just ride

Dying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life an art
Drink all day and we talk till dark
That’s the way the road dogs do it, light till dark

Don't leave me now
Don't say goodbye
Don't turn around
Leave me high and dry

I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get in trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, just ride, I just ride, I just ride

I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy
I'm tired of driving till I see stars in my eyes
It's all I've got to keep myself sane, baby
So I just ride, I just ride

I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get in trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, just ride, I just ride, I just ride

Every night I used to pray that I’d find my people and finally I did on the open road. We had nothing to lose, nothing to gain, nothing we desired anymore except to make our lives into a work of art. Live fast. Die young. Be wild. And have fun.

I believe in the country America used to be. I believe in the person I want to become. I believe in the freedom of the open road. And my motto is the same as ever. I believe in the kindness of strangers. And when I'm at war with myself, I ride. I just ride.

Who are you? Are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies? Have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them? I have. I am fucking crazy. But I am free.
