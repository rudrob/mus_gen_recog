                    No rapper can rap quite like I can
I'll take a musclebound man and put his face in the sand
Not the last Mafioso I'm a MC cop
Make you say, "Go Justin and do the wop"

Beats to the rhyme, of the rhyme I just made 
Party at the jam and tonight the lights fade 
Scooting for the loot until we all get paid 
So let's go (that was good, huh?) 

I'm ...
but I'm not at home
but I'll be back ...
You got to skip and ...
and you're number two
and this is all you got to do
Wait for a beep
You got to leave your name
You got to leave your number
You got to wait for a beep
yeah!

Wild thing
He love to do the wild thing

Now, this is the story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air

Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man, whatta mighty good man

...

I love it when you call me Big Pop-pa
Throw your hands in the air, if youse a true player

Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay
Doggy Dogg's in the ... house
Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay
Death Row's in the ... house

Just hit the Eastside of the LBC
on a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.
Seen a car full of girls ain't no need to tweak
all you skirts know what's up with 213

Straight outta Compton, crazy mother...

Hit It!
Nah, na na na nah, na na na nah, na na nah, na na nah, na na na

Here comes the hotstepper, murderer
I'm the lyrical gangster, murderer
Pick up the crew in-a de area, murderer
Still love you like that, murderer

Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)

Don't this shit make a nigga wanna (JUMP JUMP!!!!)
Don't this shit make a nigga wanna (JUMP JUMP!!!!)

Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank,

Like we always do at this time
I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky
I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky

Now there's a backseat/lover

Til you're down on her/muffin

She told me to
Walk this way!
Talk this way!
