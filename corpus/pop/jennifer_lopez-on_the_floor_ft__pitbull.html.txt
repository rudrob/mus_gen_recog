J-LO:
Let me introduce you to my party people
In the club…ha

Pitbull:
I’m loose (loose)
And everybody knows I get off the chain
Baby it’s the truth, it’s the truth
I’m like inception I play with your brain
So don’t sleep or snooze
I don’t play no games so don’t- don’t- don’t get it confused, no
‘Cause you will lose, yeah
Now-now pu-pu-pu-pu-pump it up
And back it up like a Tonka truck, dale

J-LO:
If you go hard you gotta get on the floor
If you’re a party freak then step on the floor
If you’re an animal then tear up the floor
Break a sweat on the floor, yeah we work on the floor
Don’t stop, keep it moving put your drinks up
Pick your body up and drop it on the floor
Let the rhythm change your world on the floor
You know we’re running shit tonight on the floor

J-LO & Pitbull:
Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza
Straight to LA, New York, Vegas to Africa (dale)

J-LO:
Dance the night away
Live your life and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more
(A señorita, a señorita, a señorita, a señorita)

Lalalalalalalalalalalalalala
Tonight we gon’ be it on the floor
Lalalalalalalalalalalalalala
Tonight we gon’ be it on the floor

J-LO:
I know you got it, clap your hands on the floor
And keep on rocking, rock it up on the floor
If you’re a criminal, kill it on the floor
Steal it quick on the floor, on the floor
Don’t stop keep it moving, put your drinks up
It’s getting ill it’s getting sick on the floor
We never quit, we never rest on the floor
If I ain’t wrong we’ll probably die on the floor

J-LO & Pitbull:
Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza
Straight to LA, New York, Vegas to Africa (dale)

J-LO:
Dance the night away
Live your life and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more
(A señorita, a señorita, a señorita, a señorita)

Lalalalalalalalalalalalalala
Tonight we gon’ be it on the floor
Lalalalalalalalalalalalalala
Tonight we gon’ be it on the floor

Pitbull:
That badonka donk is like a trunk full of bass on an old school Chevy
Seven tray donkey donk
All I need is some vodka and some coke 
And watch and she gon’ get Donkey Kong
Baby if you’re ready for things to get heavy
I get on the floor and act a fool if you let me, dale
Don’t believe me just bet me
My name ain’t Keith but I see why you sweat me
L.A. Miami, New York
Say no more get on the floor

J-LO:
Lalalalalalalalalalalalalala
Tonight we gon’ be it on the floor
Lalalalalalalalalalalalalala
Tonight we gon’ be it on the floor
Lalalalalalalalalalalalalala
Tonight we gon’ be it on the floor
