                    I hopped off plane at L.A.X 
with a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess. 
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, 
here I am for the first time
Look to my right and 
I see the "Hollywood" sign
This is all so crazy, 
everybody seems so famous
My tummin' turin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick 
Too much pressure 
and I'm nervous
 That's when the taxi man turned on the radio

 And the Jay-Z song was on
 And the Jay-Z song was on
 And the Jay-Z song was on!

So I put my hands up, 
they're playin' my song
The butterflies fly away, 
I'm noddin' my head like "Yeah"
Movin' my hips like "Yeah"
Got my hands up, 
they're playin' my song
  They know I'm gonna be okay
  Yeah! It's a party in the U.S.A
  Yeah! It's a party in the U.S.A!

 Get to the club in my taxi cab, 
everybody's lookin' at me now
 Like "Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks, 
she's gotta be from outta town
 So hard with my girls not around me
 It's definitely not a Nashville party 'cause all I see is stilettos
 I guess I never got the memo!
 My tummin' turin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
 Too much pressure and I'm nervous
 That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune

 And the Britney song was on
 And the Britney song was on
 And the Britney song was on!

 So I put my hands up, 
they're playin' my song
 The butterflies fly away, I
'm noddin' my head like "Yeah"
 Movin' my hips like "Yeah"
 Got my hands up, 
they're playin' my song
 They know I'm gonna be okay
 Yeah! It's a party in the U.S.A
 Yeah! It's a party in the U.S.A!

 Feel like hoppin' on a flight (on a flight )
 Back to my hometown tonight (town tonight)
 Something stops me everytime (every time)
 The DJ plays my song and I feel alright

 So I put my hands up, 
they're playin' my song
 The butterflies fly away, 
I'm noddin' my head like "Yeah"
 Movin' my hips like "Yeah"
 Got my hands up, 
they're playin' my song
 They know I'm gonna be okay
 Yeah! It's a party in the U.S.A
 Yeah! It's a party in the U.S.A!

 So I put my hands up, 
they're playin' my song
 The butterflies fly away, I
'm noddin' my head like "Yeah"
 Movin' my hips like "Yeah"
 Got my hands up, 
they're playin' my song
 They know I'm gonna be okay
 Yeah! It's a party in the U.S.A
 Yeah! It's a party in the U.S.A!
