                    You're not alone 
Together we stand 
I'll be by your side 
You know I'll take your hand 
When it gets cold 
And it feels like the end 
There's no place to go 
You know I won't give in 
No, I won't give in 

Keep holding on 
Cause you know we'll make it through 
We'll make it through 
Just stay strong 
Cause you know I'm here for you 
I'm here for you 
There's nothing you can say 
Nothing you can do 
There's no other way when it comes to the truth 
So, keep holding on 
Cause you know we'll make it through 
We'll make it through 

So far away 
I wish you were here 
Before it's too late 
This could all disappear 
Before the door's closed 
And it comes to an end 
With you by my side 
I will fight and defend 
I'll fight and defend, yeah, yeah 

Keep holding on 
Cause you know we'll make it through 
We'll make it through 
Just stay strong 
Cause you know I'm here for you 
I'm here for you 
There's nothing you can say 
Nothing you can do 
There's no other way when it comes to the truth 
So, keep holding on 
Cause you know we'll make it through 
We'll make it through 

Hear me when I say 
When I say I believe. 
Nothing's gonna change 
Nothing's gonna change destiny 
Whatever's meant to be 
Will work out perfectly 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la


Keep holding on 
Cause you know we'll make it through 
We'll make it through 
Just stay strong 
Cause you know I'm here for you 
I'm here for you 
There's nothing you can say 
Nothing you can do 
There's no other way when it comes to the truth 
So, keep holding on 
Cause you know we'll make it through 
We'll make it through 


Keep holding on 
Keep holding on 


There's nothing you can say 
Nothing you can do 
There's no other way when it comes to the truth 
So, keep holding on 
Cause you know we'll make it through 
We'll make it through
