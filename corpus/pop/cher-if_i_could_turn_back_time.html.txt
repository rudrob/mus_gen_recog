                    If i could turn back time 
If i could find a way 
I'd take back those words that hurt you 
and you'd stay 

I don't know why I did the things i did 
I don't know why I said the things i said 
Pride's like a knife it can cut deep inside 
words are like weapons, they wound sometimes 

I didn't really mean to hurt you 
I didn't wanna see you go 
I know i made you cry, but baby 

if I could turn back time 
If I could find a way, 
I'd take back those words that hurt you 
and you'd stay 
If I could reach the stars 
I'd give them all to you 
then you'd love me, love me, love me like you used to do 

if i could turn back time 

My world was shattered I was torn apart 
Like someone took a knife and drove it 
deep in my heart 
You walk out that door I swore that i didn't care 
but I lost everything darling then and there 

Too strong to tell you I was sorry 
Too proud to tell you I was wrong 
I know that I was blind, 
and ooh .. 

if I could turn back time 
If I could find a way, 
I'd take back those words that hurt you 
and you'd stay 
If I could reach the stars 
I'd give them all to you 
then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do 

oh! if I could turn back time 
if I could turn back time 
if I could turn back time 
oh! baby 

I didn't really mean to hurt you 
I didn't wanna see you go 
I know i made you cry, but baby 

Oh! if I could turn back time 
If I could find a way, 
I'd take back those words that hurt you 
If I could reach the stars 
I'd give them all to you 
then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do 

if I could turn back time 
If I could find a way...
