                    I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
I want you back
I want you back
My neighbours think I'm crazy
But they don't understand
You're all I had
You're all I had

At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself

Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side
Talking to me too
Or am I a fool
Who sits alone
Talking to the moon?

I'm feeling like I'm famous
The talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know
'Cause when the sun goes down
Someone's talking back
Yeah, they're talking back

At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself

Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side
Talking to me too
Or am I a fool
Who sits alone
Talking to the moon?

Do you ever hear me calling?
'Cause every night I'm talking to the moon!

Still trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side
Talking to me too
Or am I a fool
Who sits alone
Talking to the moon?

I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
