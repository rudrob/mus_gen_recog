                    You're beautiful, that's for sure
You'll never ever fade
You're lovely but it's not for sure
That I won't ever change
And though my love is rare
Though my love is true

I'm like a bird, I only fly away
I don't know where my soul is,
I don't know where my home is
I'm like a bird, I only fly away
I don't know where my soul is,
I don't know where my home is
All I need for you to know is

Your faith in me brings me to tears
Even after all these years
And it pains me so much to tell
That you don't know me that well
And though my love is rare
Though my love is true

I'm like a bird, I only fly away
I don't know where my soul is,
I don't know where my home is
I'm like a bird, I only fly away
I don't know where my soul is,
I don't know where my home is
All I need for you to know is

It's not that I wanna say goodbye
It's just that every time you try to tell me, me that you love me
Each and every single day I know
I gonna  have to eventually give you away
And though my love is rare
And though my love is true
Hey I'm just scared
That we may fall through

I'm like a bird,
I only fly away
I don't know where my soul is,
I don't know where my home is
I'm like a bird,
I only fly away
I don't know where my soul is,
I don't know where my home is
All I need for you to know is

I'm like a bird,
I only fly away
I don't know where my soul is,
I don't know where my home is
I'm like a bird,
I only fly away
I don't know where my soul is,
I don't know where my home is
All I need for you to know is

I'm like a bird,
I only fly away
I don't know where my soul is,
I don't know where my home is
I'm like a bird,
I only fly away
I don't know where my soul is,
I don't know where my home is
All I need for you to know is
