                    Ain't no other woman that could take your spot my..

If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me (what would you do)
If I told you, you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular (tell me would you?)
Well baby, I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl (like you)

This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you (say I do)

[Bridge:]
Because, I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sitting on the grass laying side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady
Girl you amaze me
Aint gotta do nothin crazy
See all I want you to do is be…

[Chorus x2]
My love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot my love

My love
My looooooove
My looooove
My loooooove

Now if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile at every word I wrote (what would you do?)
Would that make you want to change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team (tell me would you?)
See, what's the point in waiting anymore
Cuz girl, I never been more sure (that baby, it's you)
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you've been waiting for (just say it, I do)

[Bridge:]
Because, I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sitting on the grass laying side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady
Girl you amaze me
Aint gotta do nothin crazy
See all I want you to do is be…

[Chorus x2]
My love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
My love (so don't give away)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot my love

My love
My looooooove
My looooove
My loooooove

[TI:]
aIright it’s time to get it JT
I don’t know what she hesitating for man 
(Aye aye) Shorty, cool as a fan
On the new once again
(Baby) Still has fans from Peru to Japan
Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
Cause the girls real wild throw they hands up high
when they wanna come and kick it wit a stand up guy
you don't really wanna let the chance go by
Cause you ain't been seen wit a man so fly
(baby) Friends so fly I can go fly
Private, cause I handle my B-I
They call me candle guy, simply because I am on fire
I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try
You don't come, I ain't gonna die
Hold up, what you mean, you can't go why?
Me and you boyfriend we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it, when i aint so high
Well baby,its obvious that I ain't your guy
I ain't goin lie, I feel your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
Same part,same bullet, anywhere I chill
Just bring wit me a pair, I will

[Bridge:]
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sitting on the grass laying side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady
Girl you amaze me
Aint gotta do nothin crazy
See all I want you to do is be…

[Chorus x2:]
My love (looove)
My love (looove)
My love (looove)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot my love

My love (looove)
My love (looove)
My love (looove)
Ain't another woman that could take your spot my love
