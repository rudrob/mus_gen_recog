                    All the single ladies x7
Now put your hands up

Up in the club
We just broke up 
I'm doing my own lil' thing
You decided to dip
And now you wanna trip
‘Cause another brother noticed me
I'm up on him 
He up on me
Don't pay him any attention
Kept crying my tears
For three good years 
You can't be mad at me

‘Cause if you like it
Then you should’ve put a ring on it
If you like it
Then you should’ve put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
‘Cause if you like it
Then you should’ve put a ring on it

Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh x2

If you like it
Then you should’ve put a ring on it
If you like it
Then you should’ve put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it
Then you should’ve put a ring on it

I got gloss on my lips
A man on my hips
On me tighter than my Dereon jeans
Acting up, drink in my cup
I can care less what you think
I need no permission
Did I mention
Don't pay him any attention
‘Cause you had your turn
And now you gon’ learn
What it really feels like to miss B

‘Cause if you like it
Then you should’ve put a ring on it
If you like it
Then you should’ve put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
‘Cause if you like it
Then you should’ve put a ring on it

Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh x2

If you like it
Then you should’ve put a ring on it
If you like it
Then you should’ve put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you like it
Then you should’ve put a ring on it

Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh x2

Don't treat me to these things of the world
I'm not that kind of girl
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
Here's a man that makes me
Then takes me and delivers me
To a destiny, to infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms
Say I'm the one you want
If you don't, you'll be alone
And like a ghost, I'll be gone

All the single ladies x7
Now put your hands up

Uh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh x2

‘Cause if you like it
Then you should’ve put a ring on it
If you like it
Then you should’ve put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
‘Cause if you like it
Then you should’ve put a ring on it x2

Uh, oh, oh
