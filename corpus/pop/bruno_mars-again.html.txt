                    Hands over my head thinking what else could go wrong?
Wouldve stayed in bed, how can a day be so long?
Never believed that things happen for a reason
But how this turned out, you moved all my doubts, I believe
That for you Ill do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through, led me to you
So Id do it all over again
For you

I missed the first train, stood out in the rain, all day
Little did I know
When I caught the next train, there you were to sweep me away
Guess thats what I've waited for
Never believed that things happened for a reason
But how this turned out, you moved all my doubts, I believe
That for you Ill do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through, led me to you
So Id do it all over again

(Ohh) Who ever thought a day gone so wrong, would turn out so lovely
Im so glad I found you
Even though the day went so wrong, I wouldnt change a thing (yeah, yeah, oh Ill do it)
Ill do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through, led me to you
So Ill do it all over again (yeah, yeah ohh)
Ill do it all over again (Id do it all over, Id do it all over)
Do it all over again (Id do it all over for you, for you)
all I went through, led me to you (all I went through, it led me to you)
so Id do it all over again (over again)

Who ever thought a day gone so wrong, could turn out so lovely ohh
Who ever thought a day gone so wrong, could turn out so lovely
