                    There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free for all

When the dark
Of the night comes around
That's the time
That the animal comes alive
Looking for
Something wild

And now we lookin' like pimps
In my gold Trans-Am
Got a water bottle full of whiskey
In my handbag
Got my drunk text on
I'll regret it in the mornin'
But tonight
I don't give a...
I don't give a...
I don't give a...

There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free for all

And they turn me on
When they take it off
When they take it off
Everybody, take it off!

There's a place I know
If you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore
And there's glitter on the floor

And they turn me on
When they take it off
When they take it off
Everybody, take it off!

Lose your mind
Lose it now
Lose your clothes
In the crowd
We're delirious
Tear it down
'Til the sun comes back around

N-now we're getting so smashed
Knocking over trash cans
Eurbody breakin' bottle
It's a filthy hot mess
Gonna get faded
I'm not the designated
Driver so
I don't give a...
I don't give a...
I don't give a...

There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free for all

And they turn me on
When they take it off
When they take it off
Everybody, take it off!

There's a place I know
If you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore
And there's glitter on the floor

And they turn me on
When they take it off
When they take it off
Everybody, take it off!

Oh, oh, oh!
EVERYBODY TAKE IT OFF!
Oh, Oh, Oh!
EVERYBODY TAKE IT OFF!

Right now! TAKE IT OFF!
Right now! TAKE IT OFF!
Right now! TAKE IT OFF!
Right now! TAKE IT OFF!
Right now! TAKE IT OFF!
Right now! TAKE IT OFF!
EVERYBODY TAKE IT OFF!

There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free for all

And they turn me on
When they take it off
When they take it off
Everybody, take it off!

There's a place I know
If you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore
And there's glitter on the floor

And they turn me on
When they take it off
When they take it off
Everybody, take it off!
