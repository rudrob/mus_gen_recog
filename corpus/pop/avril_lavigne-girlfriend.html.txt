                    Hey Hey You You 
I don't like your girlfriend 
No way No way 
I think you need a new one 
Hey Hey You You 
I could be your girlfriend 

Hey Hey You You 
I know that you like me 
No way No way 
No, it's not a secret 
Hey Hey You You 
I want to be your girlfriend 

You're so fine 
I want you mine 
You're so delicious 
I think about you all the time 
You're so addictive 
Don't you know 
What I can do 
To make you feel alright 

Don't pretend 
I think you know 
I'm damn precious 
And hell yeah 
I'm the mother fucking princess 
I can tell you like me too 
And you know I'm right 

She's like so whatever 
You can do so much better 
I think we should get together now 
And that's what everyone's talking about 

Hey Hey You You 
I don't like your girlfriend 
No way No way 
I think you need a new one 
Hey Hey You You 
I could be your girlfriend 

Hey Hey You You 
I know that you like me 
No way No way 
No, it's not a secret 
Hey Hey You You 
I want to be your girlfriend 

I can see the way 
I see the way 
You look at me 
And even when you look away 
I know you think of me 
I know you talk about me all the time 
again and again 

So come over here 
and tell me what I wanna hear 
Better, yet, make your girlfriend disappear 
I don't wanna hear you say her name 
ever again 

Because... 

She's like so whatever 
You can do so much better 
I think we should get together now 
And that's what everyone's talking about 

Hey Hey You You 
I don't like your girlfriend 
No way No way 
I think you need a new one 
Hey Hey You You 
I could be your girlfriend 

Hey Hey You You 
I know that you like me 
No way No way 
No, it's not a secret 
Hey Hey You You 
I want to be your girlfriend 

In a second you'll be wrapped around my finger 
'Cause I can, 'cause I can do it better 
There's no other, so when's it gonna sink in 
She's so stupid, what the hell with your thinking? x2

Hey Hey You You
