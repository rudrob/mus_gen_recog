                    As he came into the window
It was the sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK, Annie?
Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK, Annie?
Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK, Annie?
Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK,?
Are you OK, Annie?

(Annie, are you OK?)
(Will you tell us that you're OK)
(There's a sign in the window)
(That he struck you - a crescendo Annie)
(He came into your apartment)
(He left the bloodstains on the carpet)
(Then you ran into the bedroom)
(You were struck down)
(It was your doom)

Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK Annie?
Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK Annie?
Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK Annie?
You've been hit by
You've been hit by
A smooth criminal

So they came into the outway
It was Sunday - what a black day
Mouth to mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats - intimidations

Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK Annie?
Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK Annie?
Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK Annie?
Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK Annie?

(Annie, are you OK?)
(Will you tell us that you're OK)
(There's a sign in the window)
(That he struck you - a crescendo Annie)
(He came into your apartment)
(He left the bloodstains on the carpet)
(Then you ran into the bedroom)
(You were struck down)
(It was your doom)

Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK Annie?
You've been hit by
You've been struck by
A smooth criminal

OK, I want everybody to clear the area right now!
Aaow!

(Annie, are you OK?)
I don't know!
(Will you tell us, that you're OK)
I don't know!
(There's a sign in the window)
I don't know!
(That he struck you - a crescendo Annie)
I don't know!
(He came into your apartment)
I don't know!
(Left bloodstains on the carpet)
I don't know why baby!
(Then you ran into the bedroom)
I don't know!
(You were struck down)
(It was your doom, Annie!)

(Annie, are you OK?)
Dad gone it, baby!
(Will you tell us, that you're OK)
Dad gone it, baby!
(There's a sign in the window)
Dad gone it, baby!
(That he struck you - a crescendo Annie)
Hoo! hoo!
(He came into your apartment)
Dad gone it!
(Left bloodstains on the carpet)
Hoo! hoo! hoo!
(Then you ran into the bedroom)
Dad gone it!
(You were struck down)
(It was your doom, Annie!)
Aaow!
