                    Youve been a juvenile
With a dolphin smile
With no elbow room
Youve had in your little backyard
Portected by big walls
You didnt dare look over
cause youve been too small

Now youre finally sixteen
And youre feelin old
But they wont believe
That you got a soul
cause youre only sixteen
And youre feeling real
But you cant seem to cup a feel

Why do they have to force us
Through this metamorphose
Little butterfly
No matter how you try
Youll be segregated
Youre gonna be closed off
Youre callow and youre green
cause youre caught between

Youre only sixteen
Try to cross the line
But your little wings are interwined
Youre only sixteen
And youre such a tease
And theres nothing you can do
That can really please

These children
Theyre not really bad most of them
Theyre just products
Of rotten neighborhoods
And bad family situations

You know you cant forsake it
So sit back and take it
You see youre just not ripe
So dont try and fight that

Youre only sixteen
You wanna catch a peek
But they look at you
Like youre such a freak
Well youre only sixteen
With a lot to say
But they wont give you
The time of day

Youre only sixteen!
Youre only sixteen!!
Youre just sixteen!!!
You poor little thing
