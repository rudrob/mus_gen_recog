                    He was a boy 
She was a girl 
Can i make it any more obvious?
He was a punk 
She did ballet 
What more can i say?
He wanted her 
She'd never tell secretly she wanted him as well 
But all of her friends 
Stuck up their nose 
They had a problem with his baggy clothes 

He was a skater boy 
She said see you later boy 
He wasn't good enough for her 
She had a pretty face 
But her head was up in space 
She needed to come back down to earth 

5 years from now 
She sits at home 
Feeding the baby she's all alone 
She turns on tv 
Guess who she sees?
Skater boy rockin up MTV 
She calls up her friends 
They already know 
And they've all got 
Tickets to see his show 
She tags along 
Stands in the crowd 
Looks up at the man that she turned down 

He was a skater boy 
She said see you later boy 
He wasn't good enough for her 
Now he's a super star 
Slamming on his guitar 
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

Sorry girl but you missed out 
Well tough luck that boy's mine now 
We are more than just good friends 
This is how the story ends 
Too bad that you couldn't see, 
See the man that boy could be 
There is more that meets the eye 
I see the soul that is inside 

He's just a boy 
And Im just a girl 
Can I make it any more obvious?
We are in love 
Haven't you heard 
How we rock eachothers world 

I'm with the skater boy 
I said see you later boy 
I'll be back stage after the show 
I'll be at the studio 
Singing the song we wrote 
About a girl you used to know 

I'm with the skater boy 
 I said see you later boy 
 I'll be back stage after the show 
 I'll be at the studio 
 Singing the song we wrote 
 About a girl you used to knoooow
