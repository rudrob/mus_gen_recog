                    Take away your things and go
You can't take back what you said, I know
I've heard it all before, at least a million times
I'm not one to forget, you know

I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees right now, 'ow

I'm so sick of that same old love
That shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love
My body's had enough
Oh, that same old love
Oh, that same old love
I’m so sick of that same old love
Feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love
The kind that breaks your heart
Oh, that same old love
Oh, that same old love

I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
I know, I've heard it all so don't you try and change your mind
Cause I won't be changing too, you know

You can't believe, still can't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees right now, 'ow

I'm so sick of that same old love
That shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love
My body's had enough
Oh, that same old love
Oh, that same old love
I’m so sick of that same old love
Feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love
The kind that breaks your heart
Oh, that same old love
Oh, that same old love

I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love

I'm so sick of that same old love
That shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love
My body's had enough
Oh, that same old love
Oh, that same old love
I’m so sick of that same old love
Feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love
The kind that breaks your heart
Oh, that same old love
Oh, that same old love
