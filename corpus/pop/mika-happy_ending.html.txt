                    This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No Happy Ending

Wake up in the morning, stumble on my life
Can't get no love without sacrifice
If anything should happen, I guess I wish you well
A little bit of heaven, but a little bit of hell

This is the hardest story that I have ever told
No hope or love or glory
Happy Ending is gone forever more
I feel as if I'm wasting
And I'm wasting every day

This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No Happy Ending
This is the way that we love
Like it's forever
Then live the rest of our life
But not together

Two o'clock in the morning, something is on my mind
Can't get no rest, keep walking around
If I pretend that nothing ever went wrong
I can get to my sleep
I can think that we just carried on

This is the hardest story that I have ever told
No hope or love or glory
Happy Ending is gone forever more
I feel as if I'm wasting
And I'm wasting every day
Oh I feel as if I'm wasting
And I'm wasting every day

A little bit of love, little bit of love
Little bit of love, little bit of love, little bit of love, love
I feel as if I'm wasting

This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No Happy Ending
This is the way that we love
Like it's forever
Then live the rest of our life
But not together

This is the way you left me
I'm not pretending
No hope, no love, no glory
No Happy Ending
