                    Darling, Darling, doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself ‘cause her liquor's top shelf
It's alarming honestly how charming she can be
Fooling everyone, telling them she's having fun

She says, you don't want to be like me,
don't want to see all the things I've seen
I'm dyin', I'm dyin'

She says, you don't want to get this way
Famous and dumb at an early age
Lyin', I'm lyin'

The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God, her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies, she's still shinin'
Like lightning, white lightning

Carmen, Carmen, staying up till morning
Only seventeen but she walks the streets so mean
It's alarming truly how disarming you can be
Eatin' soft ice cream, Coney Island queen

She says, you don't want to be like me
Lookin' for fun, gettin' high for free
I'm dyin', I'm dyin'

She says, you don't want to get this way
Street walk at night and a star by day
It's tirin', tirin'

The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like god, her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies, she's still shinin'
Like lightning, white lightning

Baby's all dressed up with nowhere to go
That's the little story of the girl you know
Relying on the kindness of strangers
Tying cherry knots, smiling, doing party favours

Put your red dress on, put your lipstick on
Sing your song song, now the camera's on
And you're alive again

Mon amour, je sais que tu m'aimes aussi
Tu as besoin de moi, tu as besoin de moi dans ta vie
Tu ne peux vivre sans moi et je mourrais sans toi
Je tuerais pour toi

The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like god, her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies, she's still shinin'
Like lightning, white lightning

Darlin', darlin', doesn't have a problem
Lying to herself ‘cause her liquor's top shelf
