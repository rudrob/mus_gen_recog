                    My old man is a bad man
But I can't deny the way he holds my hand 
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart

He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have a L.A. crass way about me
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart

Swimming pool glimmering darling
White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool
Bright blue ripples you 
Sitting sipping on your black crystal yeah

Light of my life, fire of my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Gimme them gold coins, gimme them coins

And I'm off to the races, cases of Bacardi chasers 
Chasing me all over town 
‘Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again at Rikers Island and I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet, singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth ready for you

My old man is a tough man
But he’s got a soul as sweet as blood red jam 
And he shows me, he knows me every inch of my tar black soul

He doesn't mind I have a flat brokedown life
In fact he says he thinks it's what he might like about me
Admires me, the way I roll like a rolling stone

He likes to watch me in the glass room 
Bathroom Chateau Marmont
Slipping on my red dress, putting on my makeup
Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac fumes
Says it feels like heaven to him

Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you own me, gimme them coins

And I'm off to the races, cases of Bacardi chasers 
Chasing me all over town 
‘Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again at Rikers Island and I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet, singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth 

Yo I'm off to the races
Laces, leather on my waist is tight and I am falling down
I can see your face is shameless, Cipriani's Basement
Love you but I'm going down
God I'm so crazy, baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlet, queen of Coney Island
Raising hell all over town, sorry 'bout it

My old man is a thief and I'm gonna stay and pray with him til the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord to watch over us
Take him when he may if he may
I'm not afraid to say that I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
I need you, I breathe you, I'd never leave you
They would rue the day I was alone without you
You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar hanging from your lips
I said, "Hun, you never looked so beautiful as you do now my man"

And we’re off to the races, places, ready set the gate is 
Down and now we’re going in
To Las Vegas, chaos, casino oasis
Honey it is time to spin
Boy you’re so crazy baby
I love you forever not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love
