                    I'm bringing sexy back
Them other boys don't know how to act
I think it's special what's behind your back
So turn around and and I'll pick up the slack
Take it to the bridge 

Dirty Babe
You see these shackles baby I'm your slave
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave
It's just that no one makes me feel this way
Take it to the chorus

Come here girl, 
go head be gone with it
Come to the back, 
go head be gone with it
VIP
go head be gone with it
drinks on me
go head be gone with it
Let me see what you're twerkin' with
go head be gone with it
Look at those hips
go head be gone with it
You make me smile
go head be gone with it
Go 'head child
go head be gone with it
And get your sexy on  (x6)
go head be gone with it

I'm bringing sexy back
Them other fuckers don't know how to act
Girl let me make up for all the things you lack
Because you're burning up I got to get it fast
Take it to the bridge

Dirty Babe
You see these shackles, baby I'm your slave
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave
It's just that no one makes me feel this way
Take it to the chorus

Come here girl, 
go head be gone with it
Come to the back, 
go head be gone with it
VIP
go head be gone with it
drinks on me
go head be gone with it
Let me see what you're twerkin' with
go head be gone with it
Look at those hips
go head be gone with it
You make me smile
go head be gone with it
Go 'head child
go head be gone with it
And get your sexy on  (x6)
go head be gone with it

I'm bringing sexy back
Them mother fuckers watch how I attack
If that's your girl you better watch your back
Cause she'll burn it up for me and that's a fact
Take it to the chorus 

Come here girl, 
go head be gone with it
Come to the back, 
go head be gone with it
VIP
go head be gone with it
drinks on me
go head be gone with it
Let me see what you're twerkin' with
go head be gone with it
Look at those hips

You make me smile
go head be gone with it
Go 'head child
go head be gone with it
And get your sexy on  (x6)
go head be gone with it
