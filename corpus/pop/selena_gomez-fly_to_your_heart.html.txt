                    Watch all the flowers
stand with the wind
listen to snowflakes whisper your name
Feel all the wonders lifting your dreams
You can fly

Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
You believe you'll find your wings
Fly to your heart

Touch every rainbow
painting the sky
look at the magic
Glide through your live
sprinkle the pixie
dust cirlcles the night
You can fly

Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
You believe you'll find your wings
Fly
Everywhere you go
Your soul will find a home
You'll be free to spread your wings

Fly
You can fly to your heart 
Rise to the heigh of all you can be
Soar on all hope of my balistic

Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
You believe you'll find your wings
Fly 
Everywhere you go
Your soul will find a home
You'll be free to spread your wings
Fly
you can fly to your heart

                    Â
