Rabiosa
If you don't get enough I'll make it double
I got my boy in big, big trouble
You know I want you, atracao ahi
Ratata

You got a lot of that sex appeal
Don't play along because I'm for real
You see that road isn't meant for me
You know I want you amarrao aqui

Oye papi
If you like it mocha
Come get a little closer
And bite me en la boca x2

Rabiosa, rabiosa 
Come closer, come pull me closer
Yo soy rabiosa, rabiosa
Come closer, come pull me closer

Shakira:
