                    I'm sitting across from you
I'm dreaming of the things I'd do
I don't speak
You don't know me at all

For fear of what you might do
I say nothing but stare at you
And I'm dreaming
I'm trippin' over you

Truth be told
My problem's old
You mean the world to me 
But you'll never know
You could be cruel to me
Why go risking the way 
That I see you
That I see you
That I see you 
That I see you 
That I see you 
That I see

Conversation's not me at all
I'm hesitating only to fall
And I'm waiting
I'm hating everyone

Could it be, you feel for me?
In any possible similarity
If it's so, how would I know?
You'll never know me at all
But I see you
But I see you
But I see you 
But I see you 
But I see you 

I'm standing across from you
I've dreamt alone, now the dreams won't do 
I'm standing across from you 
I've dreamt alone, now the dreams won't do 

Truth be told, my problem's old
You mean the world to me
But you'll never know
You could be cruel to me
Why go risking the way 
That I see you
But I see you
But I see you
But I see you
But I see you

I'm standing across from you 
I've dreamt alone, now the dreams won't do 
I'm standing across from you 
I've dreamt alone, now the dreams won't do
I'm standing across from you 
I've dreamt alone, now the dreams won't do 
I'm standing across from you 
I've dreamt alone, now the dreams won't do 

But I see you
But I see you
But I see you
But I see you
