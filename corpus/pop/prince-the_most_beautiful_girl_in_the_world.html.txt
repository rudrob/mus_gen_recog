                    Could you be
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World
It's plain to see
You're the reason that God made a girl
When the day turns into the last day of all time
I can say, I hope you are in these arms of mine
And when the night falls before that day I will cry
I will cry tears of joy
Cause after you all one can do is die

Could you be
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World
Could you be
It's plain to see
You're the reason that God made a girl
Oh yes you are

How can I get through days when I can't get through hours
I can try but when I do I see you and I'm devoured
Oh Yes
Who'd allow, who'd allow a face to be soft as a flower
I could bow and feel proud in the light of this power
Oh Yes

Could you be (Could you be)
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World
Could you be
It's plain to see
You're the reason that God made a girl
Oh yes you are

And if the stars ever fell one by one from the sky
I know Mars could not be to far behind
Cuz baby, this kind of beauty has got no reason to ever be shy
Cuz honey, this kind of beauty the kind that comes from inside

Could you be (Could you be)
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (The Most Beautiful Girl in the World)
It's plain to see (Plain to see)
You're the reason that God made a girl

Could you be (Could you be)
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World
Could you be
It's plain to see
You're the reason that God made a girl
Oh yes you are
