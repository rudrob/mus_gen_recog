                    Desmond has a barrow in the market place 
Molly is the singer in a band 
Desmond says to Molly "girl, I like your face"
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
Lala, how the life goes on 
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
Lala, how the life goes on

Desmond takes a trolley to the jewelry store 
Buys a twenty carat golden ring (den ring)
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door 
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing (to sing) 

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
Lala, how the life goes on 
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
Lala, how the life goes on (yeah) 

In a couple of years they have built home, sweet home 
With a couple of kids running in the yard 
Of Desmond and Molly Jones (Ah ha ha ha ha ha) 

Happy ever after in the market place 
Desmond lets the children lend a hand (arm, leg)
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face 
And in the evening she still sings it with the band

Yeah, ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
Lala, how the life goes on 
Hey, ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
Lala, how the life goes on

In a couple of years they have built home, sweet home 
With a couple of kids running in the yard 
Of Desmond and Molly Jones, hey (Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha) 

Happy ever after in the market place 
Molly lets the children lend a hand (foot)
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face 
And in the evening she's a singer with the band

Yeah, ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
Lala, how the life goes on 
Yeah, ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
Lala, how the life goes on

And if you want some fun take ob-la-di bla-da
Thank you
