                    I`ll get U high again
Prince gon` get U high

CHORUS:
I`ll get U high again
I`ll get U high
I`ll get U high again
Prince gon` get U high

Ooh (Uh!)

Making your way through the neighborhood
Looking 4 some good boys, toys
Bobbin` your tail 2 another one of Prince` jams
Tryin` 2 look real coy

When they pull up right beside ya (Say, baby)
And ask if they can ride ya (Where the party at?)
Your horn goes beep
The music in the jeep goes...

We got the music get U high again
Got the beat make U act like a hooligan
Got the rhyme make U tell a friend
Prince gon` get U high

CHORUS

Every now and then, U`re having one of them days
With people gettin` on your last nerve
No matter how U cut it, nothing seem 2 go your way
U wanna quit this job, get your swerve on

Turn the radio up, it`s a new day
The only way 2 see is your way
The door goes slam
Now U sing this jam, go...

We got the music get U high again
We got the beat make U act like a hooligan
We got the rhyme make U tell a friend
Prince gon` get U high

CHORUS
(Ooh-ho)
(Ohh)
(Ooh, yeah yeah yeah)

(How U gonna let another human?)
How U gonna let another human stand in the way of this truth
Who quarters the is (quarters) U putting in the telephone booth
25-1, U gon` have some fun
Put your hands up (Oh!)
If y`all ready 4 the next run

Prince gonna get U high {x6}

We got the music 2 get U high again
Got the beat that make U act like a hooligan
Got the rhyme, make U tell a friend
Prince gon` get U high

We got the music 2 get U high again
Got the beat that make U act like a hooligan

All I wanna do is get U high again (High high high)
Gonna get U high (High high high)
Prince gonna get U high again (High high high)
Check it out...

If U`ve ever been down real low
Put the jam in the jeep let`s go and get U high again (Come on)
In the mornin`, I`ll get U high
Whenever U ain`t feeling 2 good
I`ll get U high again - U don`t need nobody
Prince gonna get U high - yeah!
I`ll get U high
Prince gonna get U high
Oh, Prince gonna get U high?
