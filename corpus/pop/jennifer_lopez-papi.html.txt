                    Let all the heat pour down
I'm good as long as he's around
He lets me wear the crown
I do my best to make him proud

Now all my super ladies
I got my baby, if you got your baby, baby

Move your body, move your body
Dance for your papi
Rock your body, rock your body
Dance for your papi
Put your hands up in the air
Dance for your man if you care
Put your hands up in the air, air, air, ohohohoh

Move your body, move your body
Dance for your papi
Rock your body, rock your body
Dance for your papi

My rock is shining bright
Even if he ain't by my side
He makes sure that I glow
I make sure everybody knows

Now all my super ladies
I got my baby, if you got your baby, baby

Move your body, move your body
Dance for your papi
Rock your body, rock your body
Dance for your papi
Put your hands up in the air
Dance for your man if you care
Put your hands up in the air, air, air, ohohohoh x2

Step up, step up
Let your hair down
Pop, drop, and lock it 
Go all out
If, if he rocks
Tear up the crowd
Dance for your papi x3

Llégale, llégale
Suéltate el pelo
Levántate cae y aseguralo
Ve con todas
Sí, el es lo máximo
Azota baldosa
Baila para tu papi

Now all my super ladies
I got my baby, if you got your baby, baby

Move your body, move your body
Dance for your papi
Rock your body, rock your body
Dance for your papi
Put your hands up in the air
Dance for your man if you care
Put your hands up in the air, air, air, ohohohoh x2
