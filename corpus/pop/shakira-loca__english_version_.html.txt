Loca
Loca
Dance or die
Loca
Loca

She's playing dumb all the time
Just to keep it fun
To get you on like ah
Be careful amigo
She talking and walking just to work you up
She’d die for your love
But your love’s only mine, boy

Sigo tranquila
Like I’m on a beach in Anguilla
Sipping on Corona
Like it’s nothing going on
I ain’t leaving you alone
What is meant for me
No other girl is gonna take
So keep them off

And I’m crazy, but you like it
Loca, loca, loca
You like that it ain’t easy
Loca, loca, loca
I’m crazy but you like it
Loca, loca, loca
I’m crazy but you like it

Dizzee Rascal:
That girl is a nutter
Hot though, I heat up when I touch her
Chica caliente
Got me rapping to merengue
I feel so el presidente
I’m running shit and I’m loving it
She’s got a mean lil’ butt
But you should see what she does with it
She keeps it down low (down low, down low)
I can never get enough (oh no, oh no)

She gives me the runaround
But I stay chasing
But I mean, yo, I’m in love
With a crazy girl
But it’s all good
And it’s fine by me
Just as long as I hear her say  “Ay, papi”

And I’m crazy, but you like it
Loca, loca, loca
You like that it ain’t easy
Loca, loca, loca
I’m crazy but you like it
Loca, loca, loca
I’m crazy but you like it
(Loca, loca, loca)

You’re the one for me
And for her no more
Now you think she’s got it all
I got one kiki x2

I guess she doesn’t know the things
That I do to please you
I take you to the malecón por un caminito
They say your girl is looking for me with a rifle
‘Cause we were dancing mambo
What she doesn’t allow it?

Dizzee Rascal:
I really can't help it
If I make the lady loca
I don’t want no trouble
I just wanna hit the ooh

And I’m crazy, but you like it
‘Cause the kinda girl like me
They’re running out of in the market

And I’m crazy, but you like it
Loca, loca, loca
You like that it ain’t easy
Loca, loca, loca
I’m crazy but you like it
Loca, loca, loca
I’m crazy but you like it
Dios mío

That girl is a (loca) x3

Loca
That girl is a (loca)
That girl is a (loca)

You’re the one for me
And for her no more
Now you think she’s got it all
I got my Kiki

And I’m crazy, but you like it
Loca, loca, loca
You like that it ain’t easy
Loca, loca, loca
La loca, la loca (loca), la loca (loca)
Loca (loca)
