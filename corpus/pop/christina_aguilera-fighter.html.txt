                    (After all you put me through,
you think I'd despise you,
but in the end, I wanna thank you because you make that much stronger!)

Well I though I knew you, thinkin' that you were true
Guess I, I couldn't trust called your bluff time is up
Cause I've had enough
You were there by my side, always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames cause your greed sold me out in shame (uh mmm#0

After all of the stealing and cheating you probably think that I hold resentment for you
But uh uh, oh no, you're wrong
Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do, I wouldn't know
Just how capable I am to pull through
So I just wanna say thank you
Cause it

Chorus:
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

( oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oohhhhh aye aye yeah)

Never saw it coming, all of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in on a good thing before I'd realize your game
I heard you're goin round playin, the victim now
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame
Cause you dug your own grave
After all of the fights and the lies cause you're wanting to harm me
But that won't work anymore, no more, (oh oh )
It's over
Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down
So I wanna say thank you
Cause it

Chorus:

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

How could this man I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust so cruel
Could only see the good in you
Pretended to not to see the truth
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself
Through living in denial
But in the end you'll see
YOU-WONT-STOP-ME

I am a fighter and I (I'm a fighter)
I ain't goin' stop (ain't gonna stop)
There is no turning back
I've had enough (aaahhhhhh)

Repeat Chorus x2:

Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder (oh oh oh yeah)
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster (ooh)
Made my skin a little bit thicker (yeah yeah yeah yeah )
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter

Thought i would forget but I (ooohhh)
I remember (oooohhh)
'Cus i remember (ooooohhhh) (x2)
I remember

Makes me that much stronger (oh oh)
Makes me work a little bit harder (oh oh)
It makes me that much wiser(oh)
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter
