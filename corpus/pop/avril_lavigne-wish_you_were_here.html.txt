                    I can be tough
I can be strong
But with you, it's not like that at all
There's a girl
That gives a shit
Behind this wall
You just walk through it

And I remember all those crazy things you said
You left them running through my head
You're always there
You're everywhere
But right now I wish you were here

All those crazy things we did
Didn't think about it just went with it
You're always there
You're everywhere
But right now I wish you were here

(Chorus):
Damn, damn, damn
What I'd do to have you
Here, here, here
I wish you were here
Damn, damn, damn
What I'd do to have you
Near, near, near
I wish you were here

I love the way you are
It's who I am
Don't have to try hard
We always say
Say like it is
And the truth
Is that I really miss

All those crazy things you said
You left them running through my head
You're always there
You're everywhere
But right now I wish you were here

All those crazy things we did
Didn't think about it, just went with it
You're always there
You're everywhere
But right now I wish you were here

(Chorus):
Damn, damn, damn
What I'd do to have you
Here, here, here
I wish you were here
Damn, damn, damn
What I'd do to have you
Near, near, near
I wish you were here

No, I don't wanna let go
I just wanna let you know
That I never wanna let go
Let go, oh, oh

No, I don't wanna let go
I just wanna let you know
That I never wanna let go
Let go, let go, let go...

(Chorus x2):
Damn, damn, damn
What I'd do to have you
Here, here, here
I wish you were here
Damn, damn, damn
What I'd do to have you
Near, near, near
I wish you were here

Damn, damn, damn
What I'd do to have you
Here, here, here
I wish you were here
Damn, damn, damn
What I'd do to have you
Near, near, near
I wish you were here
