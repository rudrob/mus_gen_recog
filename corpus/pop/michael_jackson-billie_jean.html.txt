                    She was more like a beauty queen
From a movie scene
I said don't mind but what do you mean
I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round 
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed
Of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me:
Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts

And mother always told me:
Be careful of who you love
Be careful of what you do
'Cause the lie becomes the truth
Heey!

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

For forty days and for forty nights
Law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice!) Do think twice!

She told my baby we danced till three
And she looked at me
Then showed a photo, my baby cried
His eyes were like mine
Go dance on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me:
Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts

But you came and stood right by me
Just a smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
Heey!

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

She says I am the one
You know what you did
She says he is my son
Breaking my heart, baby
She says I am the one

Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is...
