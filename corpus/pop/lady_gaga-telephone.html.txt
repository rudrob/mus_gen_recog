                    Lady Gaga:
Hello hello baby you called
I can't hear a thing
I have got no service
In the club, you say? Say? 
Wha-wha-what did you say huh?
You're breaking up on me
Sorry I cannot hear you
I'm kinda busy
K-kinda busy
K-kinda busy
Sorry I cannot hear you I'm kinda busy

Just a second
It's my favorite song they gonna play
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh?
You shoulda made some plans with me
You knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me
I'm kinda busy

Stop calling
Stop calling
I don't wanna think anymore
I got my head and my heart on the dancefloor
Stop calling
Stop calling
I don't wanna talk anymore
I got my head and my heart on the dancefloor

E-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e
Stop telephoning
Me-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e
(Stop telephoning me)
I'm busy e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e
(I'm busy)
Stop telephoning
Me-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e 
(Stop telephoning me)

Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
‘Cuz I’m out in the club
And I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone x2

Beyoncé:
Boy why you blown up my phone
Won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster
Leave my girls no faster
I shoulda left my phone at home
'Cuz this is a disaster
Calling like a collector
Sorry, I can’t answer

Lady Gaga:
Not that I don't like you
I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringing

Beyoncé:
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central Station
Tonight I'm not taking no calls
'Cuz I'll be dancing
'Cuz I'll be dancing
'Cuz I'll be dancing
Tonight I'm not taking no calls
'Cuz I'll be dancing

Stop calling
Stop calling
I don't wanna think anymore
I got my head and my heart on the dancefloor
Stop calling
Stop calling
I don't wanna talk anymore
I got my head and my heart on the dancefloor x2

E-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e
(Stop telephoning)
Stop telephoning
Me-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e 
(I'm busy)
I'm busy e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e
(Stop telephoning)
Stop telephoning
Me-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e 
(I'm busy)

Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
‘Cuz I’m out in the club
And I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone x2

My telephone
Ma ma ma telephone
‘Cuz I’m out in the club
And I'm sipping that bubb
And you're not gonna reach my telephone x2
