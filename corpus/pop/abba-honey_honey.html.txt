                    Honey, honey – how you thrill me, aha, honey, honey 
Honey, honey – nearly kill me, aha, honey, honey 
I’d heard about you before 
I wanted to know some more 
And now I know what they mean 
You’re a love machine 
Oh, you make me dizzy

Honey, honey – let me feel it, aha, honey, honey 
Honey, honey – don’t conceal it, aha, honey, honey 
The way that you kiss goodnight
(The way that you kiss goodnight)
The way that you hold me tight
(The way that you hold me tight)
I feel like I wanna sing 
When you do your thing

I don’t wanna hurt you baby 
I don’t wanna see you cry 
So stay on the ground girl 
You better not get too high 
But I’m gonna stick to you boy 
You’ll never get rid of me 
There’s no other place in this world 
Where I rather would be

Honey, honey – touch me baby, aha, honey, honey 
Honey, honey - hold me baby, aha, honey, honey 
You look like a movie star
(You look like a movie star)
But I know just who you are
(I know just who you are) 
And honey to say the least 
You’re a doggone beast

So stay on the ground girl 
You better not get too high

There’s no other place in this world 
Where I rather would be

Honey, honey – how you thrill me, aha, honey, honey 
Honey, honey – nearly kill me, aha, honey, honey 
I’d heard about you before 
I wanted to know some more 
And now I know what they mean 
You’re a love machine 
Oh, you make me dizzy
