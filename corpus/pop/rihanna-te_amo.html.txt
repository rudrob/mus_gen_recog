                    "Te amo, te amo" she says to me
I hear the pain in her voice
Then we danced underneath the candelabra
She takes the lead
That's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over

Then she said, "Te amo"
Then she put her hand around my waist
I told her no, she cries, "Te amo"
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry without asking why
I said, "Te amo” 
Wish somebody tell me what she said
Don't it mean "I love you"?
Think it means "I love you"
Don't it mean "I love you"?

“Te amo, te amo” she's scared to breathe
I hold her hand, I got no choice, oh
Pulled me out on the beach, danced in the water, I start to leave
She's begging me and asking why it's over

Then she said, "Te amo"
Then she put her hand around my waist
I told her no, she cries, "Te amo"
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry without asking why
I said, "Te amo” 
Wish somebody tell me what she said
Don't it mean "I love you"?
Think it means "I love you"
Don't it mean "I love you"?

Listen we can dance but you gotta watch your hands
Watch me all night, I'll move under the light because I understand
That we all need love and I'm not afraid
I feel the love but I don't feel that way

Then she said, "Te amo"
Then she put her hand around my waist
I told her no, she cries, "Te amo"
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry without asking why
I said, "Te amo” 
Wish somebody tell me what she said
Don't it mean "I love you"?
Think it means "I love you"
Don't it mean "I love you"?
Think it means "I love you"
I love you
Te amo, te amo
Don't it mean I love you?
