                    Everyday is so wonderful 
And suddenly, it's hard to breathe 
Now and then, I get insecure 
From all the pain, I'm so ashamed 

I am beautiful no matter what they say 
Words can't bring me down 
I am beautiful in every single way 
Yes, words can't bring me down 
So don't you bring me down today 

To all your friends, you're delirious 
So consumed in all your doom 
Trying hard to fill the emptiness 
The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone 
Is that the way it is ? 

You are beautiful no matter what they say 
Words can't bring you down 
You are beautiful in every single way 
Yes, words can't bring you down 
So don't you bring me down today... 

No matter what we do 
(no matter what we do) 
No matter what we say 
(no matter what we say) 
We're the song inside the tune 
Full of beautiful mistakes 

And everywhere we go 
(and everywhere we go) 
The sun will always shine 
(sun will always shine) 
But tomorrow we might awake 
On the other side 

'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say 
Yes, words won't bring us down 
We are beautiful in every single way 
Yes, words can't bring us down...
So, don't you bring me down today 

Don't you bring me down today.
Don't you bring me down today.

                    Â
