                    By the way, every little thing about her face
Fills him up, the image so pleasing it could never be erased
Here to stay, embedded in his mind, he wishes they could be together
All the
Time

By the way she says things, the tone, just to hear her voice
He can't explain, the sound so exciting to him a perfect choice
Here to stay, embedded in his mind, he wishes they could be together
All the
Time

Crazy independent spanish speaking arty flirty red wine drinking sexy
Tomboy
With a natural way of thinking carefree innocent she's slightly sneaky
Confident and proud from another country has her way lives for today
Ty the
Way she's far away

By the way, holding her, hugging her can feel so warm
Just think about it, two bodies embracing, creating love in this form

Here to stay, embedded in his mind, he wishes they could be together
All the
Time

Crazy independent spanish speaking arty flirty red wine drinking sexy
Tomboy
With a natural way of thinking crazy

Then she kissed him and she went away
Far across to san francisco bay
You'd think that she would think again
And only want to be with him
Regardless of the things that pull her far away, she's far away...

Crazy independent spanish speaking arty flirty red wine drinking sexy
Tomboy
With a natural way of thinking crazy
By the way she's far away and by the way she's far away
Crazy independent spanish speaking arty flirty red wine drinking
By the way she's far away and by the way she's far away
