Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?

I'm your national anthem 
God you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons
Bugatti Veyron

He loves to romance them 
Reckless abandon
Holding me for ransom
Upper echelon

He says to be cool but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair 
Hand on the back of my neck
I said: "Can we party later on?" He said: "Yes"

Tell me I'm your national anthem
Booyah baby bow down making me so wow now
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Sugar sugar how now take your body downtown
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and baby heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact, kiss, kiss

I sing the national anthem 
While I'm standing
Over your body 
Hold you like a python

And you can't keep your hands off 
Me or your pants on
See what you've done to me 
King of Chevron

He said to be cool but I'm already coolest
I said to get real, don't you know who you're dealing with?
Uhm, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?

Tell me I'm your national anthem
Booyah baby bow down
Making me so wow now
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Sugar sugar how now
Take your body downtown
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and baby
Heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

It's a love story for the new age for the six page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Excessive buying overdose and dying

On our drugs and our love 
And our dreams and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake

Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his bell tower hotel

Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress

I'm your national anthem 
Boy put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation

Boy you have landed
Babe in the land of
Sweetness and danger - queen of Saigon

Tell me I'm your national anthem
Booyah baby bow down
Making me so wow now
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Sugar sugar how now
Take your body downtown
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air  and baby
Heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

Money is the anthem
God you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success

Money is the anthem
God you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success

Money is the anthem
God you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success

Money is the anthem
God you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success

And I remember when I met him. It was so clear that he was the only one for me. We both knew it right away. And as the years went on things got more difficult. We were faced with more challenges. 

I begged him to stay, try to remember what we had at the beginning. He was charismatic, magnetic, electric and everybody knew it. When he walked in every woman's head turned, everyone stood up to talk to him. He was like this hybrid, this mix of a man who couldn't contain himself. 

I always got the sense that he became torn between being a good person and missing out on all of the opportunities that life could offer a man as magnificent as him. And in that way I understood him and I loved him. I loved him. I loved him. I loved him. And I still love him. I love him.
