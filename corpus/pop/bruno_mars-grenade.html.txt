                    Easy come, easy go
That's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all
But you never give,
Should have known
you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open,
Why were they open?

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash,
You tossed it in the trash, you did.
To give me all your love is all I've ever asked
Cause what you don't understand, is

I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya ( yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah) Oh, oh
I would go through all this pain,
Take a bullet straight through my brain,
Yes, I would die for ya baby,
But you won't do the same.

No, no, no, no
Black, black, black and blue beat me till I'm numb
Tell the devil I said 'hey' when you get back to where you from
Mad woman, bad woman
That's just what you are, yeah,
You'll smile in my face
then rip the brakes out my car.

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes you did.
To give me all your love is all I've ever asked
Cause what you don't understand, is

I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah) Oh, oh
I would go through all this pain,
Take a bullet straight through my brain,
Yes, I would die for ya baby,
But you won't do the same.

If my body was on fire,
oh you'd watch me burn down in flames.
You said you loved me you're a liar
cause you never, ever, ever did baby!

But darling I'll still catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah, yeah) Oh, oh
I would go through all this pain,
Take a bullet straight through my brain,
Yes, I would die for ya baby,
But you won't do the same.
No, you won't do the same,
You wouldn't do the same,
Ooh, you'll never do the same.
No, no, no, no.
