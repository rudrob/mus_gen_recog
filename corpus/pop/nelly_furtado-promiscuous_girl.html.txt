T: Nope
N: Didn't think so

N: You expect me to just let you hit it
      But will you still respect me if you get it?

T: All I can do is try, gimme one chance
    What's the problem - I don't see no ring on your hand
    I'll be the first to admit it, 
    I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent

N: You wanna get in my world, get lost in it

T: Hey! I can't keep my mind off you
    Where you at, do you mind if I come through?

N: I'm out of this world

N: I can see you with nothing on
     Feeling on me before you bring that on

T: Bring that on?

N: You know what I mean

T: Girl, I'm a freak 
    You shouldn't say those things

N: I'm only trying to get inside of your brain
     To see if you can work me the way you say

T: It's ok, it's alright
    I got something that you're gonna like

N: Hey is it the truth or are you talking trash?
     Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash?


T: Promiscuous girl 
    Wherever you are 
    I'm all alone 
    And its you that I want
