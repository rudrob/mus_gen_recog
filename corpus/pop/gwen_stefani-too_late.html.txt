                    I just want to take you away from everyone
And keep you stashed under my pillow
And then Id take you out simply for my own pleasure
And wear you when the occasions special
Then Id put you on like a diamond
So I can sparkle and be the envy of my friends
Id probably hold the leash that Id have you on
So you cant stray and follow me around all day

Its too late now
I dont think it can fade
Its too real now
Fulfillment just adds fuel to the blaze

Compulsion has stained me
Im nervously cradling our young love
Without known limits love
Like a butterfly cupped in my hands
I peek in to see beauty trapped
Confined it flutters
Then it leaves behind colorful dust
To remind me of the special times we spent
But of course it has to leave my clutch
But enoughs never enough to make a dent

Its too late now
I dont think it can fade
Its too real now
Fulfillment just adds fuel to the blaze

And in time it will end
And there really isnt hope for the two of us
But right now I give in...

Its too late now
I dont think it can fade
Its too real now
Fulfillment just adds fuel to the blaze
Fulfillment just adds fuel to the
Fulfillment just adds fuel to the blaze.
