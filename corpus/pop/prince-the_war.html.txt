                    Chanting, repeated throughout the song:
One, two. Evolution will be colorized.

I can't hear U, say it!
Y'all ain't ready, I can't hear U, say it

Do like this...

One, two. Evolution will be colorized.

This is the War
Right on. [sarcastically]

The war will go on and on and on...
If U don't wanna miss your Saturday morning cartoons...

One, two. Evolution will be colorized.
One, two. Evolution will be colorized.
Yeah... right on. [sarcastically]

The war will go on and on...
Revolution will be...
Revolution will be...
Revolution will be on and on and...

(One, two) {repeated}

The war will go on and on and on
If U do not wish 2 be in the war U should leave now

We are about 2 challenge what U believe
If U do not wish 2 be challenged U should leave now
Saturday morning awaits

Do U love your country?
Do U love God?
Do U love your country as much as U love God?

If the government...
If the government...
If the government wants 2 put a microchip in your neck, heh heh
(Right on)

Do U still love your country?

The war will go on and on
If U do not wish 2 be challenged, leave now
The evolution will be colorized
One, two, the evolution will be colorized

We are running out of the essentials of life:
Oxygen, water, food, fertile earth

Underground right now as we speak, there is a metropolis
Awaiting, waiting... 4 U, me
Clean air, food 2 eat

Will U go, will U go?
Will U go underground 2 this metropolis, this metropolis paradise?

We are running out of the essentials of life here on earth!
Will U go, will U go, will U go?

Don't U love your country?
If your country no longer exists on this earth
But exists under this earth, will U go?

Underneath in this metropolis, there's food 2 eat, clean air
It's a paradise!

One condition: microchip in your neck

One, two, the evolution will be colorized
(Right on)

Would U stay above the metropolis, the microchip city?
Would U stay above and await your fate?

Do U trust your God?

Would U stay on top of the chip and await your fate?

2night U will be challenged, U best leave now
This war will go on and on.

One, two, the evolution will be colorized
One, two, the evolution will be colorized

Without God there is no country
Without God there is no metropolis
Without God there is no oxygen, there is no food to eat
Without God there is no chocolate microchip 4 your neck

Somebody say it!

One, two, the evolution will be colorized
In other words, there'll be a little bit of U and a little bit of me

One, two, the evolution will be colorized
The evolution will be colorized {x2}

1 4 me, 2 4 U
Preach a lie, not the truth
U give me candy and keep the stone
Gonna' need it in the war

I said, 1 4 me, 2 4 U
U preach a lie, not the truth
U give me candy and keep the stone
Gonna' eat it in the war

Batter up, pitcher down
What your teachers say, it ain't sound
Pledge allegiance 2 your flag
U tie me 2 a truck, 'n' then U drag

1 4 me, 2 4 U
U preach a lie, not a truth
U give me candy and keep the stone
U gonna eat it in the war

U give me AIDS, your history
When it comes 2 mine, another name
Many die and this is true
Red, black, yellow, even Jew
Claimin' God was backin' U
All across, what a fool.

1 4 me, 2 4 U
U preach a lie, not the truth
U give me candy, U keep the stone
Gonna eat it in the war

Shall I go on?

So U say
U got a cure?
HIV
I'm not sure

Every seed, fruit 2 bear
The great Babylon, I don't care

We know your name, it's the beast
All of God's child is your feast

When the righteous one plant the seed
No more kids with mama please

Only way 2 get there is the truth, y'all
In the war baby, come on me and U!

Come on! One, two. Evolution will be colorized
One, two. Evolution will be colorized
One, two. Evolution will be colorized
Play your organ, son

One Two.
1 4 me, 2 4 U
Preach a lie, not the truth
Give me candy, U keep the stone
What the hell is goin' on y'all?

There's a mountain that's mighty high
Can't reach the top unless U fly
Ain't about the money, it's about the gold
21st century, money just got sold, y'all

You hear me?

Money just got sold, y'all
Check the date.
It's has-been
It's all gone
Your pocketbook is next
It's about the gold y'all

One, two, the evolution will be colorized
One, two, the evolution will be
One, two, the evolution will be
The evolution will be
The... evolution... will... be... colorized

(One, two, the evolution will be colorized)
{repeated till end}
