                    Visions of you
Visions of me
Everything we wanted

I wanna be
Frozen in time
Forever in this moment

How you wanna live?
What you wanna feel?
Don’t you know you make me feel
So alive

What you wanna do?
What you wanna feel?
I know you wanna live your life right

The night is young
And so are we
We can do anything
We wanna, baby

The night is young
And so are we
We can be anyone
We wanna, baby

Cause we are
Free Free Free Free Free Free
And life is
Free Free Free Free Free Free

Don’t worry baby, I’ll be here
To make sure you’re feeling fine
To get let go of all your fears
Cuz you’re not going home tonight

How you wanna live?
What you wanna feel?
Don’t you know you make me feel
So alive

What you wanna do?
What you wanna feel?
I know you wanna live your life right

The night is young
And so are we
We can do anything
We wanna, baby

The night is young
And so are we
We can be anyone
We wanna, baby

Cause we are
Free Free Free Free Free Free
And life is
Free Free Free Free Free Free

Baby it’s all good
(Baby it’s all good)
When I look at you
(When I look at you)
And I see that you
(And I see that you)
Made it through everything
(Made it through everything)
After all of the ups and downs
(All of the ups and downs)
We figured it out
And I will know
How to ride it out

The night is young
And so are we
We can do anything
We wanna, baby

The night is young
And so are we
We can be anyone
We wanna, baby

Cause we are
Free Free Free Free Free Free
And life is
Free Free Free Free Free Free
