 Okay okay
 Roll again

Chorus:
 Get on the mic you know it easy oh my
 Get on the mic boy I love you long time
 Get on the mic you make me feel so blind
 the way you fill your mind, you know I press the whine
 and what can I say I’m feeling you

He’s a legend in the rapping
 this voice is the blame to fame
 his rhythm is similar to basketball
 the way he shakes and he fakes and he take some more

With everything he does, makes me feel his love
 when the DJ plays this song and we all sing along,
 up in the club with our dreams in the air and it’s all because
 he’s a poet, if the world doesn’t say it I hope that he knows it
 this is for Chris, big up to Nas, this is for Biggy of course,
 shout out to Brooklyn, and here’s to the Bronx where it all begin

Chorus:
 Get on the mic you know it easy oh my
 Get on the mic boy I love you long time
 Get on the mic you make me feel so blind
 the way you fill your mind, you know I press the whine
 and what can I say I’m feeling you

And I was going up and the Boggie down
 hoping that music would be my face,
 looking for a way to escape,
 recording the radio took a set tape
 they all saw to the UMC’s
 Snoop Dog, ANdre and now it’s 50
 all day, every day
 ’cause MC’s they make me feel a special way
 down town and your families,
 back up to bone thugs and harmony
 and I can’t forget the ladies,
 oh no the ladies knowing you crazy
 little kid Latifah you the queen
 saw in her poor Mary J and Eve
 you’ll need to understand
 Suga make me wanna be who I am

[Chorus:]

LL Cool J, EP and D rock in two short, easy Eve
 shout out to the..oh dirty B
 this monkey could compete school,
 Jessy Joyce and the Beasty Boy
 Cool J..our ghetto boys,
 2Pac, Ice Cube and high Tag
 Rex in the ..master flex
 made it tongues Daddy B, BDP public enemy
 DJ click in the tarest watch
 stretch Armstrong play the goodie mob,
 PO rock and you don’t stop,
 grab the one chain you don’t stop,
 it’s the sad and you don’t stop
 make it on the mic and let me see what you got

Get on the mic and let me see what you got
 Get on the mic and let me see what you got
 Get on the mic and let me see what you got
 Get on the mic and let me see you rock, Jay Z
 Get on the mic and let me see what you got
 Get on the mic and let me see what you got
 Get on the mic and let me see what you got
 let me see you rock, let me see what you got, Michele..

Get on the mic and let me see what you got
 Get on the mic and let me see what you got
 Get on the mic and let me see you what
 Get on the mic and let me see what you got
 Get on the mic and let me see what you got
 Get on the mic and let me see what you got
 let me see what you got, let me see what you got
