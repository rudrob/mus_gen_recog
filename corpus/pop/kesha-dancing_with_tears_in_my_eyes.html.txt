                    Here we go,
welcome to my funeral
without you I don't even have a pulse
all alone it's dark and cold
with every move i die

here I go
this is my confessional
a last cause, nobody can save my soul
I am so delusional
with every move i die

I have destroyed our life
it's gone, payback is sick
it's all my fault

I'm dancing
with tears in my eyes
Just fighting
To get through the night
I'm losing it
(Losing it)
(Losing it)
With every move I die

I'm faded
I'm broken inside
I've wasted the love of my life
I'm losing it
(Losing it)
(Losing it)
With every move I die

When did I
become such a hypocrite
double life,
lies that you caught me in
trust me i'm paying for it
with every move i die

On the floor
I'm just a zombie
who i am, is not who i wanna be
I'm such a tragedy
with every move i die

I have destroyed our life
it's gone, payback is sick
it's all my fault

I'm dancing
with tears in my eyes
Just fighting
To get through the night
I'm losing it
(Losing it)
(Losing it)
With every move I die

I'm faded
I'm broken inside
I've wasted the love of my life
I'm losing it
(Losing it)
(Losing it)
With every move I die

This is it and now
your really gone this time
never once thought
i'd be in pieces left behind

I'm dancing
with tears in my eyes
Just fighting
To get through the night
I'm losing it
(Losing it)
(Losing it)

With every move I die
I'm faded
I'm broken inside
I've wasted the love of my life
I'm losing it
(Losing it)
(Losing it)
With every move i die
