                    Down on the West Coast they got a saying
If you're not drinking then you're not playing
But you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?

Down on the West Coast I get this feeling like
It all could happen, that's why I'm leaving
You for the momet
You for the moment boy blue, yeah you

You're falling hard I push away, I'm feeling hot to the touch
You say you miss me and I wanna say I miss you so much
But something keeps me really quiet I'm alive I'm a lush
Your love your love your love

I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby ooh baby I'm in love

I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y cubano como yo lo-love
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby move baby I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love

Down on the West Coast they got their icons
Their silver starlets their Queens of Saigons
And you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?

Down on the West Coast they love their movies
Their golden gods and rock and roll groupies
And you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?

You push it hard I pull away, I'm feeling hotter than fire
I guess that no one ever really made me feel that much higher
Te deseo cariño, boy it's you I desire
Your love your love your love

I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby ooh baby I'm in love

I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y cubano como yo lo-love
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby move baby I'm in love

I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby ooh baby I'm in love

I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y cubano como yo lo-love
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby move baby I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
