                    You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken
When your heart's not open

Mmmmm if I could melt your heart
Mmmmm we'd never be apart
Mmmmm give yourself to me
Mmmmm you hold the key

Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you
My heart will be broken

Love is a bird
She needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

Mmmmm if I could melt your heart...

You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

Mmmmm if I could melt your heart...

If I could melt your heart

                    Â
