                    He said let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city
Away from the crowds
I thought heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall, and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins my one condition is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your 
Wildest dreams, oh, wildest dreams, oh

I say no one has to know what we do
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound, 
Nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now
He's so tall, and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your 
Wildest dreams, oh, wildest dreams, oh

You see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Some day when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around
You see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Some day when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just pretend

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, oh, wildest dreams, oh
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams
In your wildest dreams
