                    Baby, can't you see? I'm calling
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling

There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous
I'm loving it

Too high, can't come down
Losing my head
Spinning 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?

With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you, 
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do, 
Don't you know that you're toxic?

It’s get­ting late
To give you up
I took a sip
From my devil’s cup
Slowly
It’s taking over me

Too high, can't come down
It's in the air
And it's all around
Can you feel me now?

With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you, 
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do, 
Don't you know that you're toxic?
Don't you know that you're toxic?

With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you, 
Don't you know that you're toxic?

With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under (Toxic)
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you, 
Don't you know that you're toxic?

Into­xi­cate me now
With your lovin’ now
I think I’m ready now
I think I’m ready now
Into­xi­cate me now
With your lovin’ now
I think I’m ready now
