                    (Verse 1)
Standing at this liquor store,
Whisky coming through my pores, Feeling like I run this whole block.
Lotto tickets and cheap beer That's why you can catch me here, Tryna scratch my way up to the top.

(Hook)
Because my job got me going nowhere, so I ain't got a thing to lose.
Take me to a place where I don't care, this is me and my liquor store blues.

(Chorus)
I'll take one shot for my pain, One drag for my sorrow.
Get messed up today, I'll be ok tomorrow.
One shot for my pain, One drag for my sorrow. Get messed up today, I'll be ok tomorrow.

(Verse 2)
Me and my guitar tonight, singing to the city lights, tryna live on more than what I got.
Cause '68 Citrus ain't gonna pay the rent, so I'll be out here til they call the cops.

(Hook)
Because my job got me going nowhere, so I ain't got a thing to lose.
Take me to a place where I don't care, this is me and my liquor store blues.

(Chorus)
I'll take one shot for my pain, One drag for my sorrow.
Get messed up today, I'll be ok tomorrow.
One shot for my pain, One drag for my sorrow.
Get messed up today, I'll be ok tomorrow.

(Damian Marley)
Here comes junior gong
I'm flying high like Superman
I'm thinking that I run the whole block.

I don't know if it's just because
Pineapple kush between my jaws
Has got me feeling like I'm on top

Feeling like I would have stand up to the cops
And stand up to the big guys, because de whole a lot a dem saps
All de talk dem a talk and dem fly make no drop 
Nuff ghetto youth cannot escape the trap

(Chorus)
Give me this one shot for my pain, One drag for my sorrow. Get messed up today, I'll be ok tomorrow. One shot for my pain, One drag for my sorrow. Get messed up today, I'll be ok tomorrow.
