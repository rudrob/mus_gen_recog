                    Dance


Back door cracked
 We don't need a key
 We gettin for free
 No VIP sleaze

 Drink the Kool-Aid
 Follow my lead
 Now you're one of us
 you're coming with me

 It's time, to kill the lights
 And shout the DJ down
 (This place's about to ...)
 Tonight, we're taking over
 No ones gettin out

 This place's about to blow 
 blow -o-o-o-ow
 This place's about to blow 
 blow  -o -o--ow

 No what (What?)  
 We're taking control
 We get what we want
 We do what you don't
 Dirt and glitter
 Cover the floor
We're pretty and sick
We're young and we're bored

 It's time to lose your min
 And let the crazy out
 (This place's about to...)
  Tonight we taking names cause
  We don't mess around

  This place's about to blow 
  This place's about to blow 
  This place's about to blow 
  This place's about to blow

  Go, go, go, go insane, go insane
  Throw some glitter make it rain
  On the let me see them Hands
  Let me, let me see them Hands 
  Go insane
  Go insane
Throw some glitter make it rain
  On the let me see them Hands
  Let me, let me see them Hands

We are taking over (blow)
Get the used it over (blow)

  This place's about to blow 
  This place's about to blow 
  This place's about to blow 
  This place's about to blow
