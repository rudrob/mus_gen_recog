[Talking: Birtney]
"Hey, what's up this is Brit
And I'm not in right now
So do your thang!
Beep! hehehe, I'm just kiddin'"

[Talking: Friend]
"Hehehe, yo Brit
You're a nerd, you really need to change that Messager
Look, I was thinking about that movie we saw the other Wight
You know, how she had all that fame, and all that Money
And she still wasn't happy
Wouldn't that make a cool song?"

This is a story about a girl named Lucky.

Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for make-up, perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for, they go

"Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say

She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?

Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning and she keeps on winning
But tell me what happens when it stops? They go

"Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say

She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?

{"Best actress, and the winner is Lucky!"
"I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News standing outside the
Arena waiting for Lucky!"
"Oh, my God, here she comes"}

"Isn't she lucky, this Hollywood girl?"

She is so lucky, but why does she cry?
If there is nothing missing in her life
Why do tears come at night?
And they say

She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?

She's so lucky
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?
