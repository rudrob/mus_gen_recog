                    Let's have some fun this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick x2

Huh, huh

I wanna kiss you
But if I do then I might miss you babe
It's complicated and stupid
Got my ass squeezed by sexy Cupid
Guess he wants to play
Wants to play
A love game
A love game

Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough
For my heart to quit it

Let's have some fun this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick 
Don't think too much just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Let's play a lovegame
Play a lovegame
Do you want love?
Or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dans, the lovegame x2

I'm on a mission
And it involves some heavy touching, yeah
You've indicated your interest
I'm educated in sex, yes
And now I want it bad
Want it bad
A lovegame
A lovegame

Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough
For my heart to quit it

Huh, huh

Let's have some fun this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick 
Don't think too much just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

Let's play a lovegame
Play a lovegame
Do you want love?
Or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dans, the lovegame x2

I can see you staring there from across the block
With a smile on your mouth and your hand on your, huh!
The story of us, it always starts the same
With a boy and a girl and a huh and a game
And a game
And a game
And a game
A lovegame

Let's play a lovegame
Play a lovegame
Do you want love?
Or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dans, the lovegame x4
