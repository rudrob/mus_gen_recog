                    Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you all that it does is just tear me down
‘Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
It all just sounds like oh, oh, ohh

Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should’ve bought you flowers and held your hand
Should’ve gave you all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party ‘cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby’s dancing, but she's dancing with another man

My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like oh, oh, ohh

Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should’ve bought you flowers and held your hand
Should’ve gave you all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party ‘cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby’s dancing, but she's dancing with another man

Although it hurts, I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try an apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours when he has the chance
Take you to every party ‘cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should’ve done when I was your man
Do all the things I should’ve done when I was your man
