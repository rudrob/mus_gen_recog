                    The world can be a nasty place, you know it, I know it, yeah
We don’t have to fall from grace
Put down the weapons you fight with

And kill 'em with kindness, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness, kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now

We’re running out of time, chasing our lies
Everyday a small piece of you dies
Always somebody, you’re willing to fight, to be right

Your lies are bullets, your mouth's a gun
And no war in anger was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Next time you’re fighting

Kill 'em with kindness, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness, kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now

Go ahead, go ahead now
Go ahead, go ahead now

Your lies are bullets, your mouth's a gun
And no war in anger was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Next time you’re fighting

Kill 'em with kindness, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness, kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now

Go ahead, go ahead now
Go ahead, go ahead now
Go ahead, go ahead now
