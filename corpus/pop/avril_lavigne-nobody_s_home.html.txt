                    Well, I couldn't tell you why she felt that way
She felt it everyday
And I couldn't help her
I just watched her make the same mistakes again

What's wrong, what's wrong now
Too many, too many problems 
Don't know where she belongs
Where she belongs

She wants to go home but nobody's home
That's where she lies broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go 
To dry her eyes broken inside

Open your eyes and look outside
Find the reasons why
You've been rejected
And now you can't find what you've left behind

Be strong, be strong now
Too many, too many problems
Don't know where she belongs
Where she belongs

She wants to go home but nobody's home
That's where she lies broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go 
To dry her eyes broken inside

Her feelings she hides, her dreams she can't find
She's losing her mind, she's falling behind
She can't find her place, she's losing her faith
She's falling from grace, she's all over the place, yeah

She wants to go home but nobody's home
That's where she lies broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go 
To dry her eyes broken inside 

She's lost inside, lost inside, oh oh
She's lost inside, lost inside, oh oh yeah

                    Â
