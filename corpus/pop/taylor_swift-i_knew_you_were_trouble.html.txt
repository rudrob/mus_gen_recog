                    I think, I think when it's all over,
It just comes back in flashes, you know?
It's like a kaleidoscope of memories.
It just all comes back. But he never does.
I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen.
It's not really anything he said or anything he did,
It was the feeling that came along with it.
And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again.
But I don't know if I should.
I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright.
But I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you?
Maybe he knew that when he saw me.
I guess I just lost my balance.
I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him.
It was losing me.

Once upon a time
A few mistakes ago
I was in your sights
You got me alone
You found me
You found me
You found me-e-e-e-ee

I guess you didn't care
And I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard
You took a step back
Without me, without me, without me-e-e-e-e-ee

And he's long gone
When he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I would never been
So you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies
He'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know
That he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing

Now I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt
Is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see-e-e-e-e-ee

He was long gone
When he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey!

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
(Oooooh!)
So shame on me now 
Flew me to places I'd never been
So you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
(Yeah)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, (yeah) trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me... or her... or anyone... or anything
Yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
(Never been)
So you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
(You right there)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
(Uuuuuh)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble (Ooooh)
Oh, ooooh, trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

I don't know if you know who you are until you lose who you are
