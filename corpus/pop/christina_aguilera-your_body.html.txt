                    [Verse 1]
I came here tonight to get you out of my mind
I’m gonna take what I find (uh oh, yeah)
So open the box, don’t need no key I’m unlocked
And I won’t tell you to stop (uh oh, yeah)

Hey boy, I don’t need to know where you've been
All I need to know is you and no need for talking
Hey boy, so don’t even tell me your name
All I need to know is whose place and let’s get walking

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is love your body
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh
Tonight’s your lucky night, I know you want it
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh [2x]

[Verse 2]
It’s true what you heard I am a freak, I’m disturbed
So come on and give me your worst (uh oh, yeah)
We’re moving faster than slow, if you don’t know where to go
I’ll finish all from my own (uh oh, yeah)

Hey boy, I don’t need to know where you've been
All I need to know is you and no need for talking
Hey boy, so don’t even tell me your name
All I need to know is whose place and let’s get walking
Say say hey…

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is love your body
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh
Tonight’s your lucky night, I know you want it
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh [2x]

[Bridge]
I think you already know my name
I think you already know my name

Hey hey, ha, alright, say

I think you already know my name

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is love your body
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh (say)
Tonight’s your lucky night, I know you want it
Oooooh ooooh oooooh oooooooh [2x]
