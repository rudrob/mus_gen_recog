                    Broke my heart on the road 
Spent the weekends sewing the pieces back on 
Crayons and dolls pass me by
Walking gets too boring when you learn how to fly 

Not the homecoming kind 
Take the top off and who knows what you might find 
Won't confess all my sins 
You can bet all trying, but you can't always win 

'Cause I'm a gypsy, are you coming with me? 
I might steal your clothes and wear them if they fit me 
Never made agreements just like a gypsy 
And I won't back down 'cause life's already bit me 
And I won't cry, I'm too young to die if you're gonna quit me 
'Cause I'm a gypsy

I can't hide what I've done 
Scars remind me of just how far that I've come 
To whom it may concern 
Only run with scissors when you want to get hurt 

'Cause I'm a gypsy, are you coming with me? 
I might steal your clothes and wear them if they fit me 
I don’t make agreements just like a gypsy 
And I won't back down 'cause life's already bit me 
And I won't cry, I'm too young to die if you're gonna quit me 
'Cause I'm a gypsy

And I say
Hey you, you're no fool, if you say no
Ain't it just the way life goes
People fear what they don't know
Come along for the ride 
Come along for the ride

'Cause I'm a gypsy, are you coming with me? 
I might steal your clothes and wear them if they fit me 
Never made agreements just like a gypsy 
And I won't back down 'cause life's already bit me 
And I won't cry, I'm too young to die if you're gonna quit me 
'Cause I'm a gypsy
