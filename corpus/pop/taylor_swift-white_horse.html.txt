                    Boy: All I want is you. Do you love me? 
Taylor: Yeah...
Boy: Can you give me another chance?

Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
Cause I honestly believed in you
Holding on the days drag on
Stupid girl, I should have known
I should have known

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

Taylor: I've never thought I need anybody like him. I feel like he's everything what I ever wanted.
Girl: There's something you should know about him.

Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance

My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand

I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted, but I'm so sorry...

Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rearview mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now

Boy: Do you love me? 
Taylor: Yeah...
Boy: Can you give me another chance?
Taylor: No.

Oh, try and catch me now, oh

It's too late to catch me now
