                    I never came to the beach, 
Or stood by the ocean.
I never sat by the shore, 
Under the sun with my feet in the sand.
But you brought me here 
And I'm happy that you did.
Cause now I'm as free 
As birds catching the wind.
I always thought I would sink, 
So I never swam.
I never went boatin', 
Don't get how they are floatin.
And sometimes I get so scared of 
What I can't understand.

But here I'm, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

We watched the sun go down 
As we were walking
I'd spent the rest of my life standing here talking
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping I just stay the same, 
And nothing will change
And it will be us, just for a while
Do they even exist?
That's when I make the wish, 
To swim away with the fish
Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
I never would've believed you 
If three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

But here I'm, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

Next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you

We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
And you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
It's a brand new start
A dream come true in Malibu

                    Â
