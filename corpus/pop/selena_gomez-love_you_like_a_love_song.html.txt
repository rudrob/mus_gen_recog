                    It's been said and done
Every beautiful thought's been already sung
And I guess right now here's another one
So your melody will play on and on
With the best of 'em
You are beautiful
Like a dream come alive, incredible
A centerfold, miracle, lyrical
You saved my life again
And I want you to know baby

I, I love you like a love song baby
I, I love you like a love song baby
I, I love you like a love song baby
And I keep hittin' repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat
I, I love you like a love song baby
I, I love you like a love song baby
I, I love you like a love song baby
And I keep hittin' repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat

Constantly
Boy you play through my mind like a symphony
There's no way to describe
What you do to me
You just do to me
What you do
And it feels like I've been rescued
I've been set free
I am hypnotized
By your destiny
You are magical, lyrical, beautiful
You are
And I want you to know baby

I, I love you like a love song baby
I, I love you like a love song baby
I, I love you like a love song baby
And I keep hittin' repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat
I, I love you like a love song baby
I, I love you like a love song baby
I, I love you like a love song baby
And I keep hittin' repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat

No one compares
You stand alone
To every record I own
Music to my heart
That's what you are
A song that goes on and on

I, I love you like a love song baby
I, I love you like a love song baby
(I love you)
I, I love you like a love song baby
(like a love song)
And I keep hittin' repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat
(like a love song)
I, I love you like a love song baby
I, I love you like a love song baby
I, I love you like a love song baby
(I love you)
I love you
Like a Love Song
