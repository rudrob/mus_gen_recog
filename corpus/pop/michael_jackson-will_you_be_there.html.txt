                    Hold me
Like the river Jordan,
And I will then say to thee,
You are my friend

Carry me
Like you are my brother,
Love me like a mother,
Will you be there?

Weary,
Tell me, will you hold me?
When wrong, will you scold me?
When lost, will you find me?

But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end
But I'm only human

Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused
Will you show to me?
You'll be there for me
And care enough to bear me

(Hold me)
(Lay your head lowly)
(Softly then boldly)
(Carry me there)

(Lead me)
(Love me and feed me)
(Kiss me and free me)
(I will feel blessed)

(Carry)
(Carry me boldly)
(Lift me up slowly)
(Carry me there)

(Save me)
(Heal me and bathe me)
(Softly you say to me)
(I will be there)

(Lift me)
(Lift me up slowly)
(Carry me boldly)
(Show me you care)

(Hold me)
(Lay your head lowly)
(Softly then boldly)
(Carry me there)

(Need me)
