                    One, two, Three,
Not only you and me.
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between
Counting one, two, three
Peter, Paul, and Mary
Getting down with 3P
Everybody loves, uh 
Counting…

Babe, pick a night
To come out and play
If it's alright
What do you say?

Merrier the more
Triple fun that way
Twister on the floor
What do you say?

Are you in?
Living in sin is the new thing, yeah
Are you in?
I am counting…

One, two, three
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between
Counting one, two, Three…
Peter, Paul, and Mary
Getting down with 3P
Everybody loves, uh 

Three is a charm
Two is not the same
I don't see the harm
So are you game?

Let’s make a team
Make 'em say my name
Love in the extreme
Now are you game?

Are you in?
Living in sin is the new thing, yeah
Are you in?
I am counting

One, two, three
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between
Counting one, two, three
Peter, Paul, and Mary
Getting down with 3P
Everybody loves, uh 
Counting x2

What we do is innocent
Just for fun and nothing meant
If you don't like the company
Let's just do it you and me
You and me
Or three
Or four, on the floor

One, two, three
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between
Counting one, two, three
Peter, Paul, and Mary
Getting down with 3P
Everybody loves, uh 
Counting x2
