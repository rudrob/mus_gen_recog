                    I am done
Smoking gun
We've lost it all
The love is gone

She has won
Now it's no fun
We've lost it all
The love is gone

And we had magic and this is tragic
You couldn't keep your hands to yourself

I feel like our world's been infected
And somehow you left me neglected
We've found our lives been changed
Babe, you lost me

And we tried
Oh, how we cried
We lost ourselves
The love has died
And though we tried you can't deny
We're left as shells, we lost the fight

And we had magic and this is tragic
You couldn't keep your hands to yourself

I feel like our world's been infected
And somehow you left me neglected
We've found our lives been changed
Babe, you lost me

Now I know you're sorry
And we were sweet
Oh, but you chose lust when you deceived me
And you'll regret it, but it's too late
How can I ever trust you again?

I feel like our world's been infected
And somehow you left me neglected
We've found our lives been changed
Babe, you lost me
