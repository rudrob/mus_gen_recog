Lil Wayne:
Ahem, hi, I'm Tune, the man on the moon
I live on the beach, get the sand out ya shoes
And all of that changed since I met you
So we can leave that old shit in the restroom
Ok, now I’m into you, like you never knew
I’m falling for you baby, I need a parachute
So wet, I need a wetsuit
You’re way too fly, I could be ya jet fuel
Now tell me what you like
I like what you tell me
And if you understand me, than you can overwhelm me
It’s too late, it’s too late
Every finish line is the beginning of a new race
Young Money

Jennifer Lopez:
You’ve got me and I could not defend it
I tried but I had to surrender
Your style got me under the spell
Left me no other choice but to get down

But all that changed, baby when I met you
