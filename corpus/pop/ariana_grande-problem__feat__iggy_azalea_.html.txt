Problem


Hey baby even though I hate ya,
I wanna love ya, I want you !!!
And even though I can't forgive you,
I really want ta, I want you !!!

Tell me, tell me baby,
Why can't you leave me?
'Cuz even though I shouldn't want it,
I gotta have it, I want you !!!

Head in the clouds got no weight on my shoulders,
I should be wiser and realize that I've got...

(Big Sean)
One less problem without ya,
I got one less problem without ya,
I got one less problem without ya.

(Ariana)
I got one less, one less problem.

(Big Sean)
One less problem without ya,
I got one less problem without ya,
I got one less problem without ya.

(Ariana)
I got one less, one less problem.

I know your never gonna wake up,
I gotta give up, But it's you !!!
I know I shouldn't ever call back,
Or let you come back, But it's you !!!

Every time you touch me,
And say you love me,
I get a little bit breathless.
I shouldn't want it, But it's you !!!

Head in the clouds, got no weight on my shoulders,
I should be wiser and realize that I've got...

(Big Sean)

(Iggy)
It's Iggy Iggz, Uh!
What you got?
Smart money bettin' I'll be better off without you,
In no time, I'll be forgettin' all about you.
You saying' that you know but I really really doubt you,
Understand my life is easy when I ain't around you.
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'.
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence,
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit,
I let you go let you back I finally learned my lesson.
No half-stepping' either you want it or you just playin',
I'm listening to you knowing' I can't believe what you're sayin',
There's a million you's baby boo so don't be dumb,
I got 99 problems but you won't be one, like what!

(Ariana:
One less, one less problem,
One less, one less problem.

Head in the clouds, got no weight on my shoulders,
I should be wiser and realize that I've got...

(Big Sean)
One less problem without ya,
I got one less problem without ya,
I got one less problem without ya.

(Ariana)
I got one less, one less problem.

(Big Sean)
One less problem without ya,
I got one less problem without ya,
I got one less problem without ya.

(Ariana)
I got one less, one less problem.

(Big Sean)
I got one less problem without ya,
I got one less problem without ya.

(Ariana)
I got one less, one less problem.

(Big Sean)
One less problem without ya,
I got one less problem without ya,
I got one less problem without ya.

(Ariana)
I got one less, one less problem.
