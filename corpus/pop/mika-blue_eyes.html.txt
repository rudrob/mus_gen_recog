                    Ohh, Your heart is broken
To your surprise
You're sick of crying
For blue eyes
So tired of living
Misunderstood
Think you're a woman
I think you should

Come, sorrow is so peculiar
Comes in a day, then it'll never leave ya
You take a pill, wonder if it will fix you
Then wonder why sorrow has never left you

I'm talkin' 'bout blue eyes, blue eyes
What's the matter, matter
Blue eyes, blue eyes
What's the matter matter
So blind, so blind
What's the matter, matter
Blue eyes, blue eyes
What's the matter with you?

Your heart got broken
On the underground
Go find your spirit
In lost and found
Oh, I've been watching
How you behave
Not much like a lover
More like a slave

Come, sorrow is so peculiar
Comes in a day, then it'll never leave ya
You take a pill, wonder if it will fix you
Then wonder why sorrow has never left you

I'm talkin' 'bout blue eyes, blue eyes
What's the matter, matter
Blue eyes, blue eyes
What's the matter matter
so blind, so blind
What's the matter, matter
Blue eyes, blue eyes
What's the matter with...

Blue eyes, blue eyes
What's the matter matter
Blue eyes, blue eyes
What's the matter matter
So blind, so blind
What's the matter, matter
Blue eyes, blue eyes
What's the matter with you?

What's the matter with you?
