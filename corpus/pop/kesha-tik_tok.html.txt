                    Wake up in the morning feelin' like P Diddy
Hey, what up girl?
Grab my glasses on, I'm out the door - I'm gonna hit this city (Let's go)
Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't comin' back
I'm talkin' - pedicure on our toes, toes
Tryin' on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowin' up our phones, phones
Drop-topin', playing our favorite CD's
Pullin' up to the parties
Tryin' to get a little bit tipsy


Ref.:Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
Till we see the sunlight
Tik tok, on the clock
But the party don't stop and now
Oh oh oh oh, OH 
Oh oh oh

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
Till we see the sunlight
Tik tok, on the clock
But the party don't stop and now
Oh oh oh oh, OH 
Oh oh oh


2)Ain't got a care in world, but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here
Now, the dudes are lining up 'cause they hear we got swagger
But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger
Im talking 'bout - everybody gettin' crunk, crunk
Boys tryin' to touch my junk, junk
Gonna smack him if he gettin' too drunk, drunk
Now, now - we goin' til they kick us out, out
Or the police shut us down, down
Police shut us down, down
Po-po shut us 

Ref.:Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
Till we see the sunlight
Tik tok, on the clock
But the party don't stop and now
Oh oh oh oh, OH 
Oh oh oh

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
Till we see the sunlight
Tik tok, on the clock
But the party don't stop and now
Oh oh oh oh, OH 
Oh oh oh


DJ, you build me up
You break me down
My heart, it pounds
Yeah, you got me
With my hands up
You got me now
You got that song
Yeah, you got me oh-oh
DJ, you build me up
You break me down
My heart, it pounds
Yeah, you got me oh-oh
With my hands up
Put your hands up
Put your hands uuuup
Now, the party don't start till I walk in

Ref.:Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
Till we see the sunlight
Tik tok, on the clock
But the party don't stop and now
Oh oh oh oh, OH 
Oh oh oh

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'mma fight
Till we see the sunlight
Tik tok, on the clock
But the party don't stop and now
Oh oh oh oh, OH 
Oh oh oh
