                    Uh huh, life's like this
Uh huh, uh huh, that's the way it is
Cause life's like this
Uh huh, uh huh that's the way it is

Chill out whatcha yelling' for?
Lay back it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be
You will see
I like you the way you are
When we're drivin' in your car
And you're talking to me one on one but you've become
Somebody else round everyone else
You're watching your back like you can't relax
You're tryin' to be cool you look like a fool to me

Tell me
Why you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Acting like you're somebody else gets to me frustrated
Life's like this you
And you fall and you crawl and you break
And you take what you get and you turn it into
Honestly and promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No no no

You come over unannounced
Dressed up like you're somethin' else
Where you are and where it's at you see
You're making me
Laugh out when you strike your pose
Take off all your preppy clothes
You know youre not fooling anyone
When you've become
Somebody else round everyone else
Watching your back, like you can't relax
Trying to be cool you look like a fool to me

Tell me
Why you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Acting like you're somebody else gets to me frustrated
Life's like this you
And you fall and you crawl and you break
And you take what you get and you turn it into
Honestly and promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No no no

Chill out whatcha yelling for?
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could only let it be
You will see
Somebody else round everyone else
You're watching your back, like you can't relax
You're trying to be cool, you look like a fool to me

Tell me
Why you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Acting like you're somebody else gets to me frustrated
Life's like this you
And you fall and you crawl and you break
And you take what you get and you turn it into
Honestly and promise me I'm never gonna find you fake it
No no no (x2)
