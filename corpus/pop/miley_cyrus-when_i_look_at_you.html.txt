                    Everybody needs inspiration
Everybody needs a song
A beautiful melody,
When the night’s so long
Cause there is no guarantee
That this life is easy (Yeah)

When my world is falling apart
When there’s no light to break up the dark
That’s when I, I, I look at you
When the waves are flooding the shore 
and I can’t find my way home anymore
That’s when I, I, I look at you
When I look at you

I see forgiveness
I see the truth
You love me for who I am
Like the stars hold the moon
Right there where they belong 
and I know I’m not alone (Yeah)

When my world is falling apart
When there’s no light to break up the dark
That’s when I, I, I look at you
When the waves are flooding the shore 
and I can’t find my way home anymore
That’s when I, I, I look at you

You appear just like a dream to me
Just like kaleidoscope colors that 
Cover me
All I need 
Every breath that I breathe
Don’t you know 
You’re beautiful (Yeah, Yeah)

When the waves are flooding the shore 
and I can’t find my way home anymore
That’s when I, I, I look at you
I look at you
Yeah, yeah, oh-oh

You appear just like a dream to me
