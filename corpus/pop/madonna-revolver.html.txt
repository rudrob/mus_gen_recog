(My love's a revolver) x2

Oops, I guess I shot ya
My finger's on the trigger
I had a bullet with your name on it
Click-click

I'm a sex pistol
My love should be illegal
Real deal, baby
I'm no counterfeit
Click-click

Line 'em up
Knock 'em down
My looks can kill
E-O-E-O
My body's fully loaded
And I got more ammo

Line 'em up
Knock 'em down
My looks can kill
E-O-E-O
You're an accessory to murder, 'cause

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy? x2

(I let it bang, bang)

You've been hit by a smooth criminal
A bad girl, I gotcha crying to your mama
Saying I can't believe it

I've seen ya tight
Bring a knife into a gun fight
Caught up in the law right
I think I'm in love, I

Line 'em up
Knock 'em down
My looks can kill
E-O-E-O
My body's fully loaded
And I got more ammo

Line 'em up
Knock 'em down
My looks can kill
E-O-E-O
You're an accessory to murder, 'cause

My love's a revolver
My sex is a killer
Do you wanna die happy?
Do you wanna die happy? x2

I let it bang bang
I shoot 'em bang bang
I shoot 'em bang bang
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all?
I shoot 'em bang bang
I shoot 'em bang bang
I line 'em up and watch them fall

Lil Wayne:
Bang, the shooter name is Wayne
The victim didn't complain
She just screamed, shoot again
I gave her extra rounds
My barrel twist around
I am Mr. Shoot 'em down
I leave hearts on the ground
My love is a weapon
And yes, I use it well
Then I let the rose petals
Cover up the bullet shells
I never shoot and tell
I only shoot to kill
And that vest ain't gonna help ya
Even if it's made of steel
