                    R-O-C-K  MAFIA

Creation shows me what to do
I'm dancing on the floor with you
And when you touch my hand
I go crazy yeeah

The music tells me what to feel
I like you now
But is it real
By the time we say goodnight
I'll know if this is right

And  I feel you
Coming through my veins
Am I into you
Or is the music to blame

Who owns my heart
Is it love or is it art
'Cause the way you got your body moving
It's Got me confused
I can't tell if it's beat or sparks

Who owns my heart
Is it love or is it art
You know,I wanna believe
That we're a masterpiece
But sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark
Who owns my heart

The room is full
But all I see is the way
Your eyes just blaze through me
Like fire in the dark
We're like living art

And it hits me
Like a tidal wave
Are you felling me
Or is the music to blame

Who owns my heart
Is it love or is it art
'Cause the way you got your body moving
It's Got me confused
I can't tell it is beat or sparks

Who owns my heart
Is it love or is it art
You know,I wanna belive
That we're a masterpiece
But sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark
Who owns my heart

So come on, baby
Keep provokin me
Keep on roping me
Like a rodeo
Baby, pull me close
Come on, here we go (x3)

And it hits me
Like a tidal wave
Are you feeling me
Or is the music to blame

Who owns my heart
Is it love or is it art
'Cause the way you got your body movings
Got me confused
I can't tell it is beats or sparks

Who owns my heart
Is it love or is it art
You know, I wanna believe
That we are a masterpiece
But sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark
Who owns my heart
