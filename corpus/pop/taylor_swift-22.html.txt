                    It feels like a perfect night  to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
It feels like a perfect night  for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers

We’re happy, free
Confused and lonely at the same time
It’s miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight’s the night when 
We forget about the deadlines, it’s time

I don’t know about you, but I’m feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don’t know about me but I’ll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if 
We just keep dancing like we’re twenty-two, twenty-two

It seems like one of those nights this place is too crowded
Too many cool kids
(Who’s Taylor Swift anyway?)
It seems like one of those nights we ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping

We’re happy, free 
Confused and lonely in the best way
It’s miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight’s the night when 
We forget about the heartbreaks, it’s time

I don’t know about you, but I’m feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don’t know about me but I’ll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if 
We just keep dancing like we’re twenty-two, twenty-two

I don’t know about you, twenty-two, twenty-two

It feels like one of those nights, we ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights, we won’t be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights, you look like bad news
I gotta have you, I gotta have you

I don’t know about you but I’m feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright If you keep me next to you
You don’t know about me  but I’ll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if 
We just keep dancing like we’re twenty-two, twenty-two

It feels like one of those nights, we ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights, we won’t be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights, you look like bad news
I gotta have you, I gotta have you
