                    Swin­ging in the bac­ky­ard	
Pull up in your fast car
Whi­stling my name	

Open up a beer	
And you say get over here	
And play a video game	

I’m in his favo­rite sun dress	
Wat­ching me get undres­sed	
Take that body downtown	

I say you the bestest	
Lean in for a big kiss	
Put his favo­rite per­fume on	

Go play a video game	

It’s you, it’s you, it’s all for you	
Eve­ry­thing I do	
Tell you all the time	
Heaven is a place on earth with you	
Tell me all the things you want to do	
I heard that you like the bad girls	
Honey, is that true?	
It’s bet­ter than I ever even knew	
They say that the world was built for two	
Only worth living if some­body is loving you	
Baby now you do	

Sin­ging in the old bars	
Swin­ging with the old stars	
Living for the fame	

Kis­sing in the blue dark	
Play­ing pool and wild darts	
Video games	

He holds me in his big arms	
Drunk and I am seeing stars	
This is all I think of	

Wat­ching all our friends	
Fall in and out of Old Paul’s	
This is my idea of fun	

Play­ing video games	

It’s you, it’s you, it’s all for you	
Eve­ry­thing I do	
I tell you all the time	
Heaven is a place on earth with you	
Tell me all the things you want to do	
I heard that you like the bad girls	
Honey, is that true?	
It’s bet­ter than I ever even knew	
They say that the world was built for two	
Only worth living if some­body is loving you	
Baby now you do	

Now you do
