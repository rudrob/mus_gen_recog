                    You, say that I'm messing with your head (yeah x4)
All couse I was making out with your friend (yeah x4)
Love hurts whether it's right or wrong (yeah x4)
I can't stop couse I'm having too much fun (yeah x4)

You're on your knees, begging please, stay with me
But honestly I just need to be a little crazy

All my life I've been good, but now
I am thinking what the hell
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about
If you love me
If you hate me
You can't save me
Baby, baby
All my life I've been good, but now
Whoooa what the hell!

What? What? What? What the hell!

So what? If I go out on a million dates? (yeah x4)
You never call or listen to me anyway (yeah x4)
I'd rather rage than sit around and wait all day ((yeah x4)
Don't get me wrong, I just need some time to play (e-yea)

You're on your knees, begging please, stay with me
But honestly I just need to be a little crazy (crazy!)

All my life I've been good, but now
I am thinking what the hell
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about
If you love me
If you hate me
You can't save me
Baby, baby
All my life I've been good, but now
Whoooooooa what the hell!


La la la la la la la la
whoa whoa
La la la la la la la la
whoa whoa
You say that I'm messing with your head
Boy, I like messing in your bed
Yeah, I am messing with your head
When I'm messing with you in bed

All my life I've been good, but now
I am thinking what the hell (what the hell!)
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about (I don't care about!)
All my life I've been good, but now
I am thinking what the hell
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about (If you love me)
If you love me (you know)
If you hate me (you know)
You can't save me
Baby, baby (If you love me)
All my life I've been good, but now
Whoooooooa what the hell!

La la la la la la la la la
