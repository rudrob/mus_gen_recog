                    Remem­ber those walls I built?
Well, baby they’re tum­bling down
And they didn’t even put up a fight
They didn’t even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But, I never really had a doubt
Stan­ding in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It’s like I’ve been awa­ke­ned
Every rule I had you bre­akin’
It’s the risk that I’m taking
I ain’t never gonna shut you out

Eve­ry­where I’m looking now
I’m sur­ro­un­ded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you’re my saving grace
You’re eve­ry­thing I need and more
It’s writ­ten all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won’t fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo…
Halo, ooh ooh…

Hit me like a ray of sun
Bur­ning thro­ugh my dar­kest night
You’re the only one that I want
Think I’m addic­ted to your light

I swore I’d never fall again
But this don’t even feel like fal­ling
Gra­vity can’t for­get 
to pull me back to the gro­und again

And It’s like I’ve been awa­ke­ned
Every rule I had you bre­akin’
It’s the risk that I’m taking
I’m never gonna shut you out

Eve­ry­where I’m looking now
I’m sur­ro­un­ded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you’re my saving grace

You’re eve­ry­thing I need and more
It’s writ­ten all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
I pray it won’t fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo…
Halo, ooh ooh…

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo…
Halo, ooh ooh…
Halo, ooh ooh…
Halo, ooh ooh, oh…

Eve­ry­where I’m looking now
I’m sur­ro­un­ded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you’re my saving grace

You’re eve­ry­thing I need and more
It’s writ­ten all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won’t fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo…
Halo, ooh oh…

I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo…
Halo, ooh oh…
