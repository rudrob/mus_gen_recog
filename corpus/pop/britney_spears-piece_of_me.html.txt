                    Oh yeah, oh yeah

I'm Miss American Dream since I was 17
Don't matter if I step on the scene or sneak away to the Philippines
They still gon' put pictures of my derrière in the magazine
You want a piece of me? You want a piece of me?

I'm Miss Bad Media Karma, another day, another drama
Guess I can't see the harm in working and being a mama
And with a kid on my arm, I'm still an exceptional earner
You want a piece of me?

I'm Mrs. Lifestyles Of The Rich & Famous
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. Oh My God, That Britney's Shameless
(You want a piece of me?)

I'm Mrs. Extra, Extra, This Just In
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. She's Too Big, Now She's Too Thin
(You want a piece of me?)

Oh yeah, oh yeah

I'm Mrs. You Wanna Piece Of Me?
Trying and pissing me off
Well get in line with the paparazzi
Who's flipping me off

Hoping I'll resort to some havoc
End up settling in court
Now are you sure you want a piece of me?
(You want a piece of me?)

I'm Mrs. Most Likely To Get On The TV For Stripping On The Streets
When getting the groceries, no, for real are you kidding me?
No wonder there's panic in the industry
I mean, please, do you want a piece of me?

I'm Mrs. Lifestyles Of The Rich & Famous
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. Oh My God, That Britney's Shameless
(You want a piece of me?)

I'm Mrs. Extra, Extra, This Just In
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. She's Too Big, Now She's Too Thin
(You want a piece of me?)

Oh yeah, oh yeah

I'm Miss American Dream since I was 17
Don't matter if I step on the scene or sneak away to the Philippines
They still gon' put pictures of my derrière in the magazine
You want a piece of me? You want a piece, piece of me?
You want a piece of me?

I'm Mrs. Lifestyles Of The Rich & Famous
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. Oh My God, That Britney's Shameless
(You want a piece of me?)

I'm Mrs. Extra, Extra, This Just In
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. She's Too Big, Now She's Too Thin

Oh yeah
You want a piece of me?
Oh yeah, oh yeah
